What's New in Python 3.4.7 final?
=================================

*Release date: 2017-08-09*

Library
-------

- bpo-30119: ftplib.FTP.putline() now throws ValueError on commands that
  contains CR or LF. Patch by Dong-hee Na.


What's New in Python 3.4.7 release candidate 1?
===============================================

*Release date: 2017-07-23*

Security
--------

- bpo-29591: Update expat copy from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 to get fixes of
  CVE-2016-0718 and CVE-2016-4472. See
  https://sourceforge.net/p/expat/bugs/537/ for more information.

- bpo-30694: Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple
  security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity
  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0's fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash).  Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os- specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesn't
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using ``XML_SetHashSalt()``.

- bpo-26657: Fix directory traversal vulnerability with http.server on
  Windows. This fixes a regression that was introduced in 3.3.4rc1 and
  3.4.0rc1. Based on patch by Philipp Hagemeister.

- bpo-30500: Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, ``splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')`` now correctly returns the
  ``127.0.0.1`` host, instead of treating ``@evil.com`` as the host in an
  authentification (``login@host``).

- bpo-30730: Prevent environment variables injection in subprocess on
  Windows.  Prevent passing other invalid environment variables and command
  arguments.

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-23309: Avoid a deadlock at shutdown if a daemon thread is aborted
  while it is holding a lock to a buffered I/O object, and the main thread
  tries to use the same I/O object (typically stdout or stderr).  A fatal
  error is emitted instead.

- bpo-22977: Fixed formatting Windows error messages on Wine. Patch by
  Martin Panter.

- bpo-23803: Fixed str.partition() and str.rpartition() when a separator is

  fork() failure when preexec_fn is used.

- bpo-6478: _strptime's regexp cache now is reset after changing timezone
  with time.tzset().

- bpo-23972: Updates asyncio datagram create method allowing reuseport and
  reuseaddr socket options to be set prior to binding the socket. Mirroring
  the existing asyncio create_server method the reuseaddr option for
  datagram sockets defaults to True if the O/S is 'posix' (except if the
  platform is Cygwin). Patch by Chris Laws.

- bpo-25304: Add asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe().  This lets you submit a
  coroutine to a loop from another thread, returning a
  concurrent.futures.Future.  By Vincent Michel.

- bpo-25319: When threading.Event is reinitialized, the underlying condition
  should use a regular lock rather than a recursive lock.

- bpo-19143: platform module now reads Windows version from kernel32.dll to
  avoid compatibility shims.

- bpo-23517: Fix rounding in fromtimestamp() and utcfromtimestamp() methods
  of datetime.datetime: microseconds are now rounded to nearest with ties
  going to nearest even integer (ROUND_HALF_EVEN), instead of being rounding
  towards zero (ROUND_DOWN). It's important that these methods use the same
  rounding mode than datetime.timedelta to keep the property:
  (datetime(1970,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=t)) ==
  datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t). It also the rounding mode used by
  round(float) for example.

- bpo-24684: socket.socket.getaddrinfo() now calls
  PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() instead of calling the encode() method of the
  host, to handle correctly custom string with an encode() method which
  doesn't return a byte string. The encoder of the IDNA codec is now called
  directly instead of calling the encode() method of the string.

- bpo-24982: shutil.make_archive() with the "zip" format now adds entries
  for directories (including empty directories) in ZIP file.

- bpo-24857: Comparing call_args to a long sequence now correctly returns a
  boolean result instead of raising an exception.  Patch by A Kaptur.

- bpo-23144: Make sure that HTMLParser.feed() returns all the data, even
  when convert_charrefs is True.

- bpo-16180: Exit pdb if file has syntax error, instead of trapping user in
  an infinite loop.  Patch by Xavier de Gaye.

- bpo-21112: Fix regression in unittest.expectedFailure on subclasses. Patch
  from Berker Peksag.

- bpo-24931: Instances of subclasses of namedtuples have their own __dict__
  which breaks the inherited __dict__ property and breaks the _asdict()
  method. Removed the __dict__ property to prevent the conflict and fixed
  _asdict().

- bpo-24764: cgi.FieldStorage.read_multi() now ignores the Content-Length
  header in part headers. Patch written by Peter Landry and reviewed by
  Pierre Quentel.

IDLE
----

- bpo-15348: Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.

- bpo-24455: Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended
  for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow
  any existing interaction to terminate first.

- Change 'The program' to 'Your program' in an IDLE 'kill program?' message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.

- bpo-24750: Improve the appearance of the IDLE editor window status bar.
  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-25313: Change the handling of new built-in text color themes to better
  address the compatibility problem introduced by the addition of IDLE Dark.
  Consistently use the revised idleConf.CurrentTheme everywhere in idlelib.

- bpo-24782: Extension configuration is now a tab in the IDLE Preferences
  dialog rather than a separate dialog.   The former tabs are now a sorted
  list.  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-22726: Re-activate the config dialog help button with some content
  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.

- bpo-24820: IDLE now has an 'IDLE Dark' built-in text color theme. It is
  more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
  Strings, comments, keywords, ... are still green, red, orange, ... . To
  use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the 'Save as New
  Custom Theme' button and enter a new name, such as 'Custom Dark'.  The
  custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.

- bpo-25224: README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  'IDLE' now means 'Integrated Development and Learning Environment'.

- bpo-24820: Users can now set breakpoint colors in Settings -> Custom
  Highlighting. Original patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-24972: Inactive selection background now matches active selection
  background, as configured by users, on all systems.  Found items are now
  always highlighted on Windows.  Initial patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-24570: Idle: make calltip and completion boxes appear on Macs affected
  by a tk regression.  Initial patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-24988: Idle ScrolledList context menus (used in debugger) now work on
  Mac Aqua. Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-24801: Make right-click for context menu work on Mac Aqua. Patch by

  OSX, make them a 'sheet'.  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-25198: Enhance the initial html viewer now used for Idle Help. *
  Properly indent fixed-pitch text (patch by Mark Roseman). * Give code
  snippet a very Sphinx- like light blueish-gray background. * Re-use
  initial width and height set by users for shell and editor. * When the
  Table of Contents (TOC) menu is used, put the section header at the top of
  the screen.

- bpo-25225: Condense and rewrite Idle doc section on text colors.

- bpo-21995: Explain some differences between IDLE and console Python.

- bpo-25219: Update doc for Idle command line options. Some were missing and
  notes were not correct.

- bpo-24861: Most of idlelib is private and subject to change. Use
  idleib.idle.* to start Idle. See idlelib.__init__.__doc__.

- bpo-25199: Idle: add synchronization comments for future maintainers.

- bpo-16893: Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display. The new
  idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html. It looks
  better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released. The
  tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Mark Roseman.
  The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are
  deprecated.

- bpo-24199: Deprecate unused idlelib.idlever with possible removal in 3.6.

  sensitive TkFixedFont.  This should not affect current customized font
  selections.  If there is a problem, edit $HOME/.idlerc/config-main.cfg and
  remove 'fontxxx' entries from [Editor Window].  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-21192: Idle editor. When a file is run, put its name in the restart
  bar. Do not print false prompts. Original patch by Adnan Umer.

- bpo-13884: Idle menus. Remove tearoff lines. Patch by Roger Serwy.

- bpo-23184: remove unused names and imports in idlelib. Initial patch by Al

- bpo-23016: A warning no longer produces an AttributeError when the program
  is run with pythonw.exe.

- bpo-21775: shutil.copytree(): fix crash when copying to VFAT. An exception

  AttributeError when run on Linux (and, presumably, any other non-Windows
  OS). Patch by Greg Ward.

- bpo-1218234: Fix inspect.getsource() to load updated source of reloaded
  module. Initial patch by Berker Peksag.

===============================================

*Release date: 2014-09-22*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-22258: Fix the the internal function set_inheritable() on Illumos.
  This platform exposes the function ``ioctl(FIOCLEX)``, but calling it
  fails with errno is ENOTTY: "Inappropriate ioctl for device".
  set_inheritable() now falls back to the slower ``fcntl()`` (``F_GETFD``
  and then ``F_SETFD``).

- bpo-21669: With the aid of heuristics in SyntaxError.__init__, the parser
  now attempts to generate more meaningful (or at least more search engine
  friendly) error messages when "exec" and "print" are used as statements.

- bpo-21642: In the conditional if-else expression, allow an integer written
  with no space between itself and the ``else`` keyword (e.g. ``True if
  42else False``) to be valid syntax.

- bpo-21523: Fix over-pessimistic computation of the stack effect of some
  opcodes in the compiler.  This also fixes a quadratic compilation time
  issue noticeable when compiling code with a large number of "and" and "or"
  operators.

Library
-------

- bpo-21091: Fix API bug: email.message.EmailMessage.is_attachment is now a
  method. Since EmailMessage is provisional, we can change the API in a
  maintenance release, but we use a trick to remain backward compatible with
  3.4.0/1.

- bpo-21079: Fix email.message.EmailMessage.is_attachment to return the
  correct result when the header has parameters as well as a value.

- bpo-22247: Add NNTPError to nntplib.__all__.

- bpo-4180: The warnings registries are now reset when the filters are
  modified.

- bpo-22419: Limit the length of incoming HTTP request in wsgiref server to
  65536 bytes and send a 414 error code for higher lengths. Patch
  contributed by Devin Cook.

- Lax cookie parsing in http.cookies could be a security issue when combined
  with non-standard cookie handling in some Web browsers.  Reported by
  Sergey Bobrov.

- bpo-22384: An exception in Tkinter callback no longer crashes the program
  when it is run with pythonw.exe.

- bpo-22168: Prevent turtle AttributeError with non-default Canvas on OS X.

- bpo-21147: sqlite3 now raises an exception if the request contains a null
  character instead of truncate it.  Based on patch by Victor Stinner.

  result of Treeview.heading().

- bpo-19524: Fixed resource leak in the HTTP connection when an invalid
  response is received.  Patch by Martin Panter.

- bpo-22051: turtledemo no longer reloads examples to re-run them.
  Initialization of variables and gui setup should be done in main(), which
  is called each time a demo is run, but not on import.

- bpo-21933: Turtledemo users can change the code font size with a menu
  selection or control(command) '-' or '+' or control-mousewheel. Original
  patch by Lita Cho.

- bpo-21597: The separator between the turtledemo text pane and the drawing
  canvas can now be grabbed and dragged with a mouse.  The code text pane
  can be widened to easily view or copy the full width of the text.  The
  canvas can be widened on small screens.  Original patches by Jan Kanis and
  Lita Cho.

- bpo-18132: Turtledemo buttons no longer disappear when the window is
  shrunk.  Original patches by Jan Kanis and Lita Cho.

- bpo-22216: smtplib now resets its state more completely after a quit.  The
  most obvious consequence of the previous behavior was a STARTTLS failure
  during a connect/starttls/quit/connect/starttls sequence.

  caused by mutation of the waiters queue without holding the lock.  Patch
  by Doug Zongker.

  particular this allows to initialize images from binary data.

- bpo-17172: Make turtledemo start as active on OS X even when run with

  support of 8 bit characters.

- bpo-21888: plistlib's load() and loads() now work if the fmt parameter is
  specified.

- bpo-21781: ssl.RAND_add() now supports strings longer than 2 GB.

- bpo-11453: asyncore: emit a ResourceWarning when an unclosed file_wrapper

- bpo-21858: Better handling of Python exceptions in the sqlite3 module.

- bpo-21476: Make sure the email.parser.BytesParser TextIOWrapper is
  discarded after parsing, so the input file isn't unexpectedly closed.

  call.  (Issue identified and fixed by Lita Cho.)

- bpo-21635: The difflib SequenceMatcher.get_matching_blocks() method cache
  didn't match the actual result.  The former was a list of tuples and the
  latter was a list of named tuples.

- bpo-21463: In urllib.request, fix pruning of the FTP cache.

- bpo-21618: The subprocess module could fail to close open fds that were
  inherited by the calling process and already higher than POSIX resource
  limits would otherwise allow.  On systems with a functioning /proc/self/fd

- bpo-21552: Fixed possible integer overflow of too long string lengths in
  the tkinter module on 64-bit platforms.

- bpo-14315: The zipfile module now ignores extra fields in the central
  directory that are too short to be parsed instead of letting a

- bpo-20879: Delay the initialization of encoding and decoding tables for
  base32, ascii85 and base85 codecs in the base64 module, and delay the
  initialization of the unquote_to_bytes() table of the urllib.parse module,
  to not waste memory if these modules are not used.

- bpo-19157: Include the broadcast address in the usuable hosts for IPv6 in
  ipaddress.

- bpo-11599: When an external command (e.g. compiler) fails, distutils now
  prints out the whole command line (instead of just the command name) if
  the environment variable DISTUTILS_DEBUG is set.

- bpo-4931: distutils should not produce unhelpful "error: None" messages
  anymore. distutils.util.grok_environment_error is kept but doc-deprecated.

  keyword arguments passed as keyword arguments become keyword-only.

- bpo-21209: Fix asyncio.tasks.CoroWrapper to workaround a bug in yield-from
  implementation in CPythons prior to 3.4.1.

  3.4.1: assume externally supplied sphinx-build is available in /usr/bin.

C API
-----

  match what importlib does; this affects _frozen_importlib as well as any
  module loaded using imp.init_frozen().

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-17386: Expanded functionality of the ``Doc/make.bat`` script to make
  it much more comparable to ``Doc/Makefile``.

- bpo-21043: Remove the recommendation for specific CA organizations and to
  mention the ability to load the OS certificates.

- bpo-20765: Add missing documentation for PurePath.with_name() and
  PurePath.with_suffix().

- bpo-19407: New package installation and distribution guides based on the
  Python Packaging Authority tools. Existing guides have been retained as
  legacy links from the distutils docs, as they still contain some required
  reference material for tool developers that isn't recorded anywhere else.

- bpo-19697: Document cases where __main__.__spec__ is None.

Tests
-----

- bpo-18604: Consolidated checks for GUI availability.  All platforms now at
  least check whether Tk can be instantiated when the GUI resource is

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-20625: Parameter names in __annotations__ were not mangled properly.
  Discovered by Jonas Wielicki, patch by Yury Selivanov.

- bpo-20261: In pickle, lookup __getnewargs__ and __getnewargs_ex__ on the
  type of the object.

- bpo-20619: Give the AST nodes of keyword-only arguments a column and line
  number.

- bpo-20526: Revert changes of issue #19466 which introduces a regression:
  don't clear anymore the state of Python threads early during the Python
  shutdown.

Library
-------

- bpo-20710: The pydoc summary line no longer displays the "self" parameter
  for bound methods.

- bpo-20566: Change asyncio.as_completed() to use a Queue, to avoid O(N**2)
  behavior.

- bpo-20704: Implement new debug API in asyncio. Add new methods
  BaseEventLoop.set_debug() and BaseEventLoop.get_debug(). Add support for
  setting 'asyncio.tasks._DEBUG' variable with 'PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG'
  environment variable.

- asyncio: Refactoring and fixes: BaseEventLoop.sock_connect() raises an
  error if the address is not resolved; use __slots__ in Handle and
  TimerHandle; as_completed() and wait() raise TypeError if the passed list
  of Futures is a single Future; call_soon() and other 'call_*()' functions
  raise TypeError if the passed callback is a coroutine function;
  _ProactorBasePipeTransport uses _FlowControlMixin;
  WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_size() calls _maybe_pause_protocol() to
  consider pausing receiving if the watermark limits have changed; fix
  _check_resolved_address() for IPv6 address; and other minor improvements,
  along with multiple documentation updates.

- bpo-20684: Fix inspect.getfullargspec() to not to follow __wrapped__

  streams.open_unix_connection(), and streams.start_unix_server().

- bpo-20616: Add a format() method to tracemalloc.Traceback.

- bpo-19744: the ensurepip installation step now just prints a warning to
  stderr rather than failing outright if SSL/TLS is unavailable. This allows
  local installation of POSIX builds without SSL/TLS support.

What's New in Python 3.4.0 release candidate 1?
===============================================

*Release date: 2014-02-10*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-19255: The builtins module is restored to initial value before
  cleaning other modules.  The sys and builtins modules are cleaned last.

- bpo-20588: Make Python-ast.c C89 compliant.

- bpo-20437: Fixed 22 potential bugs when deleting objects references.

- bpo-20500: Displaying an exception at interpreter shutdown no longer risks
  triggering an assertion failure in PyObject_Str.

- bpo-20538: UTF-7 incremental decoder produced inconsistent string when
  input was truncated in BASE64 section.

- bpo-20404: io.TextIOWrapper (and hence the open() builtin) now uses the
  internal codec marking system added for issue #19619 to throw LookupError
  for known non- text encodings at stream construction time. The existing
  output type checks remain in place to deal with unmarked third party
  codecs.

- bpo-17162: Add PyType_GetSlot.

- bpo-20162: Fix an alignment issue in the siphash24() hash function which
  caused a crash on PowerPC 64-bit (ppc64).

Library
-------

- bpo-20530: The signatures for slot builtins have been updated to reflect
  the fact that they only accept positional-only arguments.

- bpo-20517: Functions in the os module that accept two filenames now
  register both filenames in the exception on failure.

- bpo-20563: The ipaddress module API is now considered stable.

- bpo-14983: email.generator now always adds a line end after each MIME
  boundary marker, instead of doing so only when there is an epilogue.  This
  fixes an RFC compliance bug and solves an issue with signed MIME parts.

- bpo-20540: Fix a performance regression (vs. Python 3.2) when layering a
  multiprocessing Connection over a TCP socket.  For small payloads, Nagle's
  algorithm would introduce idle delays before the entire transmission of a
  message.

- bpo-16983: the new email header parsing code will now decode encoded words
  that are (incorrectly) surrounded by quotes, and register a defect.

- bpo-19772: email.generator no longer mutates the message object when doing
  a down- transform from 8bit to 7bit CTEs.

- bpo-20536: the statistics module now correctly handle Decimal instances
  with positive exponents

- bpo-18805: the netmask/hostmask parsing in ipaddress now more reliably
  filters out illegal values and correctly allows any valid prefix length.

- bpo-20481: For at least Python 3.4, the statistics module will require
  that all inputs for a single operation be of a single consistent type, or
  else a mixed of ints and a single other consistent type. This avoids some
  interoperability issues that arose with the previous approach of coercing
  to a suitable common type.

- bpo-20478: the statistics module now treats collections.Counter inputs
  like any other iterable.

- bpo-17369: get_filename was raising an exception if the filename
  parameter's RFC2231 encoding was broken in certain ways.  This was a
  regression relative to python2.

- bpo-20013: Some imap servers disconnect if the current mailbox is deleted,
  and imaplib did not handle that case gracefully.  Now it handles the 'bye'
  correctly.

- bpo-20531: Revert 3.4 version of fix for #19063, and apply the 3.3
  version.  That is, do *not* raise an error if unicode is passed to
  email.message.Message.set_payload.

- bpo-20476: If a non-compat32 policy is used with any of the email parsers,
  EmailMessage is now used as the factory class.  The factory class should
  really come from the policy; that will get fixed in 3.5.

- bpo-19920: TarFile.list() no longer fails when outputs a listing
  containing non- encodable characters.  Based on patch by Vajrasky Kok.

- bpo-20515: Fix NULL pointer dereference introduced by issue #20368.

- bpo-19186: Restore namespacing of expat symbols inside the pyexpat module.

- bpo-20053: ensurepip (and hence venv) are no longer affected by the
  settings in the default pip configuration file.

- bpo-20426: When passing the re.DEBUG flag, re.compile() displays the debug
  output every time it is called, regardless of the compilation cache.

- bpo-20368: The null character now correctly passed from Tcl to Python.
  Improved error handling in variables-related commands.

- bpo-20435: Fix _pyio.StringIO.getvalue() to take into account newline
  translation settings.

- tracemalloc: Fix slicing traces and fix slicing a traceback.

- bpo-20354: Fix an alignment issue in the tracemalloc module on 64-bit
  platforms. Bug seen on 64-bit Linux when using "make profile-opt".

- bpo-17159: inspect.signature now accepts duck types of functions, which
  adds support for Cython functions. Initial patch by Stefan Behnel.

- bpo-18801: Fix inspect.classify_class_attrs to correctly classify
  object.__new__ and object.__init__.

- Fixed cmath.isinf's name in its argument parsing code.

- bpo-20311: poll and epoll now round the timeout away from zero, instead of
  rounding towards zero, in select and selectors modules:
  select.epoll.poll(), selectors.PollSelector.poll() and
  selectors.EpollSelector.poll(). For example, a timeout of one microsecond
  (1e-6) is now rounded to one millisecondi (1e-3), instead of being rounded
  to zero.  However, the granularity property and asyncio's resolution
  feature were removed again. (See also: bpo-20452)

- asyncio: Some refactoring; various fixes; add write flow control to unix
  pipes; Future.set_exception() instantiates the exception argument if it is
  a class; improved proactor pipe transport; support wait_for(f, None);
  don't log broken/disconnected pipes; use ValueError instead of assert for
  forbidden subprocess_{shell,exec} arguments; added a convenience API for
  subprocess management; added StreamReader.at_eof(); properly handle
  duplicate coroutines/futures in gather(), wait(), as_completed(); use a
  bytearray for buffering in StreamReader; and more.

- bpo-20288: fix handling of invalid numeric charrefs in HTMLParser.

- bpo-20424: Python implementation of io.StringIO now supports lone
  surrogates.

- bpo-20308: inspect.signature now works on classes without user-defined
  __init__ or __new__ methods.

- bpo-20372: inspect.getfile (and a bunch of other inspect functions that
  use it) doesn't crash with unexpected AttributeError on classes defined in
  C without __module__.

- bpo-20356: inspect.signature formatting uses '/' to separate positional-
  only parameters from others.

- bpo-20223: inspect.signature now supports methods defined with
  functools.partialmethods.

- bpo-19456: ntpath.join() now joins relative paths correctly when a drive
  is present.

- bpo-19077: tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup no longer fails when called
  during shutdown.  Emitting resource warning in __del__ no longer fails.
  Original patch by Antoine Pitrou.

- bpo-20394: Silence Coverity warning in audioop module.

- bpo-20367: Fix behavior of concurrent.futures.as_completed() for duplicate
  arguments. Patch by Glenn Langford.

- bpo-8260: The read(), readline() and readlines() methods of
  codecs.StreamReader returned incomplete data when were called after
  readline() or read(size). Based on patch by Amaury Forgeot d'Arc.

- bpo-20105: the codec exception chaining now correctly sets the traceback
  of the original exception as its __traceback__ attribute.

- bpo-17481: inspect.getfullargspec() now uses inspect.signature() API.

- bpo-15304: concurrent.futures.wait() can block forever even if Futures
  have completed. Patch by Glenn Langford.

- bpo-14455: plistlib: fix serializing integers in the range of an unsigned
  long long but outside of the range of signed long long for binary plist
  files.

IDLE
----

- bpo-20406: Use Python application icons for Idle window title bars. Patch
  mostly by Serhiy Storchaka.

- Update the python.gif icon for the Idle classbrowser and pathbowser from
  the old green snake to the new blue and yellow snakes.

- bpo-17721: Remove non-functional configuration dialog help button until we
  make it actually gives some help when clicked. Patch by Guilherme Simões.

Tests
-----

- bpo-20532: Tests which use _testcapi now are marked as CPython only.

- bpo-19920: Added tests for TarFile.list().  Based on patch by Vajrasky
  Kok.

- bpo-19990: Added tests for the imghdr module.  Based on patch by Claudiu
  Popa.

- bpo-20474: Fix test_socket "unexpected success" failures on OS X 10.7+.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-20530: Argument Clinic's signature format has been revised again. The
  new syntax is highly human readable while still preventing false
  positives.  The syntax also extends Python syntax to denote "self" and
  positional-only parameters, allowing inspect.Signature objects to be
  totally accurate for all supported builtins in Python 3.4.

- bpo-20456: Argument Clinic now observes the C preprocessor conditional
  compilation statements of the C files it parses.  When a Clinic block is
  inside a conditional code, it adjusts its output to match, including
  automatically generating an empty methoddef macro.

- bpo-20456: Cloned functions in Argument Clinic now use the correct name,
  not the name of the function they were cloned from, for text strings
  inside generated code.

- bpo-20456: Fixed Argument Clinic's test suite and "--converters" feature.

- bpo-20456: Argument Clinic now allows specifying different names for a
  parameter in Python and C, using "as" on the parameter line.

- bpo-20326: Argument Clinic now uses a simple, unique signature to annotate
  text signatures in docstrings, resulting in fewer false positives.  "self"
  parameters are also explicitly marked, allowing inspect.Signature() to
  authoritatively detect (and skip) said parameters.

- bpo-20326: Argument Clinic now generates separate checksums for the input
  and output sections of the block, allowing external tools to verify that
  the input has not changed (and thus the output is not out-of-date).

Build
-----

- bpo-20465: Update SQLite shipped with OS X installer to 3.8.3.

C API
-----

- bpo-20517: Added new functions allowing OSError exceptions to reference
  two filenames instead of one: PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObjects() and
  PyErr_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilenameObjects().

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-20488: Change wording to say importlib is *the* implementation of
  import instead of just *an* implementation.

- bpo-6386: Clarify in the tutorial that specifying a symlink to execute
  means the directory containing the executed script and not the symlink is
  added to sys.path.


What's New in Python 3.4.0 beta 3?
==================================

*Release date: 2014-01-26*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-20189: Four additional builtin types (PyTypeObject,
  PyMethodDescr_Type, _PyMethodWrapper_Type, and PyWrapperDescr_Type) have
  been modified to provide introspection information for builtins.

- bpo-17825: Cursor "^" is correctly positioned for SyntaxError and
  IndentationError.

- bpo-2382: SyntaxError cursor "^" is now written at correct position in
  most cases when multibyte characters are in line (before "^").  This still
  not works correctly with wide East Asian characters.

- bpo-18960: The first line of Python script could be executed twice when
  the source encoding was specified on the second line.  Now the source
  encoding declaration on the second line isn't effective if the first line
  contains anything except a comment.  'python -x' works now again with
  files with the source encoding declarations, and can be used to make
  Python batch files on Windows.

Library
-------

- asyncio: Various improvements and small changes not all covered by issues
  listed below.  E.g. wait_for() now cancels the inner task if the timeout
  occcurs; tweaked the set of exported symbols; renamed Empty/Full to
  QueueEmpty/QueueFull; "with (yield from lock)" now uses a separate context
  manager; readexactly() raises if not enough data was read; PTY support
  tweaks.

- bpo-20311: asyncio: Add a granularity attribute to BaseEventLoop: maximum
  between the resolution of the BaseEventLoop.time() method and the
  resolution of the selector. The granuarility is used in the scheduler to
  round time and deadline.

- bpo-20311: selectors: Add a resolution attribute to BaseSelector.

- bpo-20189: unittest.mock now no longer assumes that any object for which
  it could get an inspect.Signature is a callable written in Python. Fix
  courtesy of Michael Foord.

- bpo-20317: ExitStack.__exit__ could create a self-referential loop if an
  exception raised by a cleanup operation already had its context set
  correctly (for example, by the @contextmanager decorator). The infinite
  loop this caused is now avoided by checking if the expected context is
  already set before trying to fix it.

- bpo-20374: Fix build with GNU readline >= 6.3.

- bpo-20262: Warnings are raised now when duplicate names are added in the
  ZIP file or too long ZIP file comment is truncated.

- bpo-20165: The unittest module no longer considers tests marked with
  @expectedFailure successful if they pass.

- bpo-18574: Added missing newline in 100-Continue reply from
  http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler. Patch by Nikolaus Rath.

- bpo-20270: urllib.urlparse now supports empty ports.

- bpo-20243: TarFile no longer raise ReadError when opened in write mode.

- bpo-20238: TarFile opened with external fileobj and "w:gz" mode didn't
  write complete output on close.

- bpo-20245: The open functions in the tarfile module now correctly handle
  empty mode.

- bpo-20242: Fixed basicConfig() format strings for the alternative
  formatting styles. Thanks to kespindler for the bug report and patch.

- bpo-20246: Fix buffer overflow in socket.recvfrom_into.

- bpo-20206: Fix edge case in email.quoprimime.encode where it truncated
  lines ending in a character needing encoding but no newline by using a
  more efficient algorithm that doesn't have the bug. (See also: bpo-5803)

- bpo-19082: Working xmlrpc.server and xmlrpc.client examples. Both in
  modules and in documentation. Initial patch contributed by Vajrasky Kok.

- bpo-20138: The wsgiref.application_uri() and wsgiref.request_uri()
  functions now conform to PEP 3333 when handle non-ASCII URLs.

- bpo-19097: Raise the correct Exception when cgi.FieldStorage is given an
  invalid fileobj.

- bpo-20152: Ported Python/import.c over to Argument Clinic.

- bpo-13107: argparse and optparse no longer raises an exception when output
  a help on environment with too small COLUMNS.  Based on patch by Elazar
  Gershuni.

- bpo-20207: Always disable SSLv2 except when PROTOCOL_SSLv2 is explicitly
  asked for.

- bpo-18960: The tokenize module now ignore the source encoding declaration
  on the second line if the first line contains anything except a comment.

- bpo-20078: Reading malformed zipfiles no longer hangs with 100% CPU
  consumption.

- bpo-20113: os.readv() and os.writev() now raise an OSError exception on
  error instead of returning -1.

- bpo-19719: Make importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_module(),
  PathEntryFinder.find_loader(), and Loader.load_module() use PEP 451 APIs
  to help with backwards-compatibility.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-20390: Argument Clinic's "file" output preset now defaults to
  "{dirname}/clinic/{basename}.h".

- bpo-20390: Argument Clinic's "class" directive syntax has been extended
  with two new required arguments: "typedef" and "type_object".

- bpo-20390: Argument Clinic: If __new__ or __init__ functions didn't use
  kwargs (or args), the PyArg_NoKeywords (or PyArg_NoPositional) calls
  generated are only run when the type object is an exact match.

- bpo-20390: Argument Clinic now fails if you have required parameters after
  optional parameters.

- bpo-20390: Argument Clinic converters now have a new template they can
  inject code into: "modifiers".  Code put there is run in the parsing
  function after argument parsing but before the call to the impl.

- bpo-20376: Argument Clinic now escapes backslashes in docstrings.

- bpo-20381: Argument Clinic now sanity checks the default argument when
  c_default is also specified, providing a nice failure message for
  disallowed values.

- bpo-20189: Argument Clinic now ensures that parser functions for __new__
  are always of type newfunc, the type of the tp_new slot. Similarly, parser
  functions for __init__ are now always of type initproc, the type of
  tp_init.

- bpo-20189: Argument Clinic now suppresses the docstring for __new__ and
  __init__ functions if no docstring is provided in the input.

- bpo-20189: Argument Clinic now suppresses the "self" parameter in the impl
  for @staticmethod functions.

- bpo-20294: Argument Clinic now supports argument parsing for __new__ and
  __init__ functions.

- bpo-20299: Argument Clinic custom converters may now change the default
  value of c_default and py_default with a class member.

- bpo-20287: Argument Clinic's output is now configurable, allowing delaying
  its output or even redirecting it to a separate file.

- bpo-20226: Argument Clinic now permits simple expressions (e.g.
  "sys.maxsize - 1") as default values for parameters.

- bpo-19936: Added executable bits or shebang lines to Python scripts which
  requires them.  Disable executable bits and shebang lines in test and
  benchmark files in order to prevent using a random system python, and in
  source files of modules which don't provide command line interface.  Fixed
  shebang lines in the unittestgui and checkpip scripts.

- bpo-20268: Argument Clinic now supports cloning the parameters and return
  converter of existing functions.

- bpo-20228: Argument Clinic now has special support for class special
  methods.

- bpo-20214: Fixed a number of small issues and documentation errors in
  Argument Clinic (see issue for details).

- bpo-20196: Fixed a bug where Argument Clinic did not generate correct
  parsing code for functions with positional-only parameters where all
  arguments are optional.

- bpo-18960: 2to3 and the findnocoding.py script now ignore the source
  encoding declaration on the second line if the first line contains
  anything except a comment.

- bpo-19723: The marker comments Argument Clinic uses have been changed to
  improve readability.

- bpo-20157: When Argument Clinic renames a parameter because its name
  collides with a C keyword, it no longer exposes that rename to
  PyArg_Parse.

- bpo-20141: Improved Argument Clinic's support for the PyArg_Parse "O!"
  format unit.

- bpo-20144: Argument Clinic now supports simple symbolic constants as
  parameter default values.

  in socketmodule.c.


What's New in Python 3.4.0 beta 2?
==================================

*Release date: 2014-01-05*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-17432: Drop UCS2 from names of Unicode functions in python3.def.

- bpo-19526: Exclude all new API from the stable ABI. Exceptions can be made
  if a need is demonstrated.

- bpo-19969: PyBytes_FromFormatV() now raises an OverflowError if "%c"
  argument is not in range [0; 255].

- bpo-19995: %c, %o, %x, and %X now issue a DeprecationWarning on non-
  integer input; reworded docs to clarify that an integer type should define
  both __int__ and __index__.

- bpo-19787: PyThread_set_key_value() now always set the value. In Python
  3.3, the function did nothing if the key already exists (if the current
  value is a non-NULL pointer).

- bpo-14432: Remove the thread state field from the frame structure. Fix a
  crash when a generator is created in a C thread that is destroyed while
  the generator is still used. The issue was that a generator contains a
  frame, and the frame kept a reference to the Python state of the destroyed
  C thread. The crash occurs when a trace function is setup.

- bpo-19576: PyGILState_Ensure() now initializes threads. At startup, Python
  has no concrete GIL. If PyGILState_Ensure() is called from a new thread
  for the first time and PyEval_InitThreads() was not called yet, a GIL
  needs to be created.

- bpo-17576: Deprecation warning emitted now when __int__() or __index__()
  return not int instance.

- bpo-19932: Fix typo in import.h, missing whitespaces in function
  prototypes.

- bpo-19736: Add module-level statvfs constants defined for GNU/glibc based
  systems.

- bpo-20097: Fix bad use of "self" in importlib's WindowsRegistryFinder.

- bpo-19729: In str.format(), fix recursive expansion in format spec.

- bpo-19638: Fix possible crash / undefined behaviour from huge (more than 2
  billion characters) input strings in _Py_dg_strtod.

Library
-------

- bpo-20154: Deadlock in asyncio.StreamReader.readexactly().

- bpo-16113: Remove sha3 module again.

- Fix breakage in TestSuite.countTestCases() introduced by issue #11798.

- bpo-20108: Avoid parameter name clash in inspect.getcallargs().

- bpo-19918: Fix PurePath.relative_to() under Windows.

- bpo-19422: Explicitly disallow non-SOCK_STREAM sockets in the ssl module,
  rather than silently let them emit clear text data.

- bpo-20046: Locale alias table no longer contains entities which can be
  calculated. Generalized support of the euro modifier.

- bpo-20027: Fixed locale aliases for devanagari locales.

- bpo-20067: Tkinter variables now work when wantobjects is false.

- bpo-19020: Tkinter now uses splitlist() instead of split() in configure
  methods.

- bpo-19744: ensurepip now provides a better error message when Python is
  built without SSL/TLS support (pip currently requires that support to run,
  even if only operating with local wheel files)

- bpo-19734: ensurepip now ignores all pip environment variables to avoid
  odd behaviour based on user configuration settings

- Fix TypeError on "setup.py upload --show-response".

- bpo-20045: Fix "setup.py register --list-classifiers".

- bpo-18879: When a method is looked up on a temporary file, avoid closing
  the file before the method is possibly called.

- bpo-20037: Avoid crashes when opening a text file late at interpreter
  shutdown.

- bpo-19967: Thanks to the PEP 442, asyncio.Future now uses a destructor to
  log uncaught exceptions, instead of the dedicated _TracebackLogger class.

- Added a Task.current_task() class method to asyncio.

- bpo-19850: Set SA_RESTART in asyncio when registering a signal handler to
  limit EINTR occurrences.

- Implemented write flow control in asyncio for proactor event loop
  (Windows).

- Change write buffer in asyncio use to avoid O(N**2) behavior.  Make
  write()/sendto() accept bytearray/memoryview.

- bpo-20034: Updated alias mapping to most recent locale.alias file from
  X.org distribution using makelocalealias.py.

- bpo-5815: Fixed support for locales with modifiers.  Fixed support for
  locale encodings with hyphens.

- bpo-20026: Fix the sqlite module to handle correctly invalid isolation
  level (wrong type).

- bpo-18829: csv.Dialect() now checks type for delimiter, escapechar and
  quotechar fields.  Original patch by Vajrasky Kok.

- bpo-19855: uuid.getnode() on Unix now looks on the PATH for the
  executables used to find the mac address, with /sbin and /usr/sbin as
  fallbacks.

- bpo-20007: HTTPResponse.read(0) no more prematurely closes connection.
  Original patch by Simon Sapin.

- bpo-19946: multiprocessing now uses runpy to initialize __main__ in child
  processes when necessary, allowing it to correctly handle scripts without
  suffixes and submodules that use explicit relative imports or otherwise
  rely on parent modules being correctly imported prior to execution.

- bpo-19921: When Path.mkdir() is called with parents=True, any missing
  parent is created with the default permissions, ignoring the mode argument
  (mimicking the POSIX "mkdir -p" command).

- bpo-19887: Improve the Path.resolve() algorithm to support certain symlink
  chains.

- bpo-19912: Fixed numerous bugs in ntpath.splitunc().

- bpo-19911: ntpath.splitdrive() now correctly processes the 'İ' character
  (U+0130, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE).

- bpo-19532: python -m compileall with no filename/directory arguments now
  respects the -f and -q flags instead of ignoring them.

- bpo-19623: Fixed writing to unseekable files in the aifc module.

- bpo-19946: multiprocessing.spawn now raises ImportError when the module to
  be used as the main module cannot be imported.

- bpo-17919: select.poll.register() again works with poll.POLLNVAL on AIX.
  Fixed integer overflow in the eventmask parameter.

- bpo-19063: if a Charset's body_encoding was set to None, the email package
  would generate a message claiming the Content-Transfer-Encoding was 7bit,
  and produce garbage output for the content.  This now works. A couple of
  other set_payload mishandlings of non-ASCII are also fixed. In addition,
  calling set_payload with a string argument without specifying a charset
  now raises an error (this is a new error in 3.4).

- bpo-15475: Add __sizeof__ implementations for itertools objects.

- bpo-19944: Fix importlib.find_spec() so it imports parents as needed and
  move the function to importlib.util.

- bpo-19880: Fix a reference leak in unittest.TestCase. Explicitly break
  reference cycles between frames and the _Outcome instance.

- bpo-17429: platform.linux_distribution() now decodes files from the UTF-8
  encoding with the surrogateescape error handler, instead of decoding from
  the locale encoding in strict mode. It fixes the function on Fedora 19
  which is probably the first major distribution release with a non-ASCII
  name. Patch written by Toshio Kuratomi.

- bpo-19343: Expose FreeBSD-specific APIs in resource module.  Original
  patch by Koobs.

- bpo-19929: Call os.read with 32768 within subprocess.Popen.communicate
  rather than 4096 for efficiency.  A microbenchmark shows Linux and OS X
  both using ~50% less cpu time this way.

- bpo-19506: Use a memoryview to avoid a data copy when piping data to stdin
  within subprocess.Popen.communicate.  5-10% less cpu usage.

- bpo-19876: selectors unregister() no longer raises ValueError or OSError
  if the FD is closed (as long as it was registered).

- bpo-19908: pathlib now joins relative Windows paths correctly when a drive
  is present. Original patch by Antoine Pitrou.

- bpo-19296: Silence compiler warning in dbm_open

- bpo-6784: Strings from Python 2 can now be unpickled as bytes objects by
  setting the encoding argument of Unpickler to be 'bytes'. Initial patch by
  Merlijn van Deen.

  EOF, and analogous bug in lzma module.

- bpo-19881: Fix pickling bug where cpickle would emit bad pickle data for
  large bytes string (i.e., with size greater than 2**32-1).

- bpo-19138: doctest's IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL now allows a match when no
  exception detail exists (no colon following the exception's name, or a
  colon does follow but no text follows the colon).

- bpo-19927: Add __eq__ to path-based loaders in importlib.

- bpo-19827: On UNIX, setblocking() and settimeout() methods of
  socket.socket can now avoid a second syscall if the ioctl() function can
  be used, or if the non- blocking flag of the socket is unchanged.

- bpo-19785: smtplib now supports SSLContext.check_hostname and server name
  indication for TLS/SSL connections.

- bpo-19784: poplib now supports SSLContext.check_hostname and server name
  indication for TLS/SSL connections.

- bpo-19783: nntplib now supports SSLContext.check_hostname and server name
  indication for TLS/SSL connections.

- bpo-19781: ftplib now supports SSLContext.check_hostname and server name
  indication for TLS/SSL connections.

- bpo-19509: Add SSLContext.check_hostname to match the peer's certificate
  with server_hostname on handshake.

- bpo-15798: Fixed subprocess.Popen() to no longer fail if file descriptor
  0, 1 or 2 is closed.

- bpo-17897: Optimized unpickle prefetching.

  constructor is given a str. Move the array module typecode documentation
  to the docstring of the constructor.

- bpo-19088: Fixed incorrect caching of the copyreg module in
  object.__reduce__() and object.__reduce_ex__().

  Patch by Daniel Urban.

- bpo-6477: Added support for pickling the types of built-in singletons
  (i.e., Ellipsis, NotImplemented, None).

- bpo-19713: Add remaining PEP 451-related deprecations and move away from
  using find_module/find_loaer/load_module.

- bpo-19708: Update pkgutil to use the new importer APIs.

What's New in Python 3.4.0 beta 1?
==================================

*Release date: 2013-11-24*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Use the repr of a module name in more places in import, especially
  exceptions.

- bpo-19619: str.encode, bytes.decode and bytearray.decode now use an
  internal API to throw LookupError for known non-text encodings, rather
  than attempting the encoding or decoding operation and then throwing a
  TypeError for an unexpected output type. (The latter mechanism remains in
  place for third party non-text encodings)

- bpo-19183: Implement PEP 456 'secure and interchangeable hash algorithm'.
  Python now uses SipHash24 on all major platforms.

- bpo-12892: The utf-16* and utf-32* encoders no longer allow surrogate code
  points (U+D800-U+DFFF) to be encoded.  The utf-32* decoders no longer
  decode byte sequences that correspond to surrogate code points.  The
  surrogatepass error handler now works with the utf-16* and utf-32* codecs.
  Based on patches by Victor Stinner and Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu.

- bpo-17806: Added keyword-argument support for "tabsize" to
  str/bytes.expandtabs().

- bpo-17828: Output type errors in str.encode(), bytes.decode() and
  bytearray.decode() now direct users to codecs.encode() or codecs.decode()
  as appropriate.

- bpo-17828: The interpreter now attempts to chain errors that occur in
  codec processing with a replacement exception of the same type that
  includes the codec name in the error message. It ensures it only does this
  when the creation of the replacement exception won't lose any information.

- bpo-19466: Clear the frames of daemon threads earlier during the Python
  shutdown to call objects destructors. So "unclosed file" resource warnings
  are now corretly emitted for daemon threads.

- bpo-19514: Deduplicate some _Py_IDENTIFIER declarations. Patch by Andrei
  Dorian Duma.

- bpo-17936: Fix O(n**2) behaviour when adding or removing many subclasses
  of a given type.

- bpo-19428: zipimport now handles errors when reading truncated or invalid
  ZIP archive.

- bpo-18408: Add a new PyFrame_FastToLocalsWithError() function to handle
  exceptions when merging fast locals into f_locals of a frame.
  PyEval_GetLocals() now raises an exception and return NULL on failure.

- bpo-19369: Optimized the usage of __length_hint__().

- bpo-18603: Ensure that PyOS_mystricmp and PyOS_mystrnicmp are in the
  Python executable and not removed by the linker's optimizer.

- bpo-19306: Add extra hints to the faulthandler module's stack dumps that
  these are "upside down".

Library
-------

- bpo-3158: doctest can now find doctests in functions and methods written
  in C.

- bpo-13477: Added command line interface to the tarfile module. Original
  patch by Berker Peksag.

  builtins.

- bpo-19722: Added opcode.stack_effect(), which computes the stack effect of
  bytecode instructions.

- bpo-19735: Implement private function ssl._create_stdlib_context() to
  create SSLContext objects in Python's stdlib module. It provides a single
  configuration point and makes use of SSLContext.load_default_certs().

- bpo-16203: Add re.fullmatch() function and regex.fullmatch() method, which
  anchor the pattern at both ends of the string to match. Original patch by
  Matthew Barnett.

- bpo-13592: Improved the repr for regular expression pattern objects. Based
  on patch by Hugo Lopes Tavares.

- bpo-19641: Added the audioop.byteswap() function to convert big-endian
  samples to little-endian and vice versa.

- bpo-15204: Deprecated the 'U' mode in file-like objects.

- bpo-17810: Implement PEP 3154, pickle protocol 4.

- bpo-19668: Added support for the cp1125 encoding.

- bpo-19689: Add ssl.create_default_context() factory function. It creates a
  new SSLContext object with secure default settings.

- bpo-19727: os.utime(..., None) is now potentially more precise under
  Windows.

- bpo-17201: ZIP64 extensions now are enabled by default.  Patch by William
  Mallard.

  certificates from default stores or system stores. By default the method
  loads CA certs for authentication of server certs.

- bpo-19673: Add pathlib to the stdlib as a provisional module (PEP 428).

- bpo-16596: pdb in a generator now properly skips over yield and yield from
  rather than stepping out of the generator into its caller.  (This is
  essential for stepping through asyncio coroutines.)

- bpo-17916: Added dis.Bytecode.from_traceback() and
  dis.Bytecode.current_offset to easily display "current instruction"
  markers in the new disassembly API (Patch by Claudiu Popa).

- bpo-19552: venv now supports bootstrapping pip into virtual environments

- bpo-17134: Finalize interface to Windows' certificate store. Cert and CRL
  enumeration are now two functions. enum_certificates() also returns
  purpose flags as set of OIDs.

- bpo-19555: Restore sysconfig.get_config_var('SO'), (and the distutils
  equivalent) with a DeprecationWarning pointing people at $EXT_SUFFIX.

- bpo-8813: Add SSLContext.verify_flags to change the verification flags of
  the context in order to enable certification revocation list (CRL) checks
  or strict X509 rules.

- bpo-18294: Fix the zlib module to make it 64-bit safe.

- bpo-19682: Fix compatibility issue with old version of OpenSSL that was
  introduced by Issue #18379.

- bpo-19633: Fixed writing not compressed 16- and 32-bit wave files on big-
  endian platforms.

- bpo-18379: SSLSocket.getpeercert() returns CA issuer AIA fields, OCSP and
  CRL distribution points.

- bpo-18138: Implement cadata argument of SSLContext.load_verify_location()
  to load CA certificates and CRL from memory. It supports PEM and DER
  encoded strings.

- bpo-18775: Add name and block_size attribute to HMAC object. They now
  provide the same API elements as non-keyed cryptographic hash functions.

- bpo-17276: MD5 as default digestmod for HMAC is deprecated. The HMAC
  module supports digestmod names, e.g. hmac.HMAC('sha1').

- bpo-19449: in csv's writerow, handle non-string keys when generating the
  error message that certain keys are not in the 'fieldnames' list.

- bpo-13633: Added a new convert_charrefs keyword arg to HTMLParser that,
  when True, automatically converts all character references.

- bpo-2927: Added the unescape() function to the html module.

- bpo-8402: Added the escape() function to the glob module.

- bpo-17618: Add Base85 and Ascii85 encoding/decoding to the base64 module.

- bpo-19634: time.strftime("%y") now raises a ValueError on AIX when given a
  year before 1900.

- Fix test.support.bind_port() to not cause an error when Python was
  compiled on a system with SO_REUSEPORT defined in the headers but run on a
  system with an OS kernel that does not support that reasonably new socket
  option.

- Fix compilation error under gcc of the ctypes module bundled libffi for
  arm.

- bpo-19448: Add private API to SSL module to lookup ASN.1 objects by OID,
  NID, short name and long name.

  year before 1900 and a format of %y.

- bpo-19406: implementation of the ensurepip module (part of PEP 453). Patch
  by Donald Stufft and Nick Coghlan.

  printing output.

- bpo-19378: the "line_offset" parameter in the new "dis.get_instructions"
  API has been renamed to "first_line" (and the default value and usage
  changed accordingly). This should reduce confusion with the more common
  use of "offset" in the dis docs to refer to bytecode offsets.

- bpo-18678: Corrected spwd struct member names in spwd module:
  sp_nam->sp_namp, and sp_pwd->sp_pwdp.  The old names are kept as extra

  directories for all configurations: non-framework vs framework, and single
  arch vs universal builds.  pythonx.y-32 is now always installed for
  64-bit/32-bit universal builds.  The obsolete and undocumented pythonw*
  symlinks are no longer installed anywhere.

- bpo-19553: PEP 453 - "make install" and "make altinstall" now install or
  upgrade pip by default, using the bundled pip provided by the new
  ensurepip module.  A new configure option, --with-
  ensurepip[=upgrade|install|no], is available to override the default
  ensurepip "--upgrade" option.  The option can also be set with "make
  [alt]install ENSUREPIP=[upgrade|install|no]".

- bpo-19551: PEP 453 - the OS X installer now installs pip by default.

  (pass --without-pip to request the old behaviour)

- bpo-19390: Argument Clinic no longer accepts malformed Python and C ids.


What's New in Python 3.4.0 alpha 4?
===================================

*Release date: 2013-10-20*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-19301: Give classes and functions that are explicitly marked global a
  global qualname.

- bpo-19279: UTF-7 decoder no longer produces illegal strings.

- bpo-16612: Add "Argument Clinic", a compile-time preprocessor for C files
  to generate argument parsing code.  (See PEP 436.)

- bpo-18810: Shift stat calls in importlib.machinery.FileFinder such that
  the code is optimistic that if something exists in a directory named
  exactly like the possible package being searched for that it's in
  actuality a directory.

- bpo-18416: importlib.machinery.PathFinder now treats '' as the cwd and
  importlib.machinery.FileFinder no longer special-cases '' to '.'. This
  leads to modules imported from cwd to now possess an absolute file path
  for __file__ (this does not affect modules specified by path on the CLI
  but it does affect -m/runpy). It also allows FileFinder to be more
  consistent by not having an edge case.

- bpo-4555: All exported C symbols are now prefixed with either "Py" or
  "_Py".

- bpo-19219: Speed up marshal.loads(), and make pyc files slightly (5% to
  10%) smaller.

- bpo-19221: Upgrade Unicode database to version 6.3.0.

- bpo-16742: The result of the C callback PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer must
  now be a string allocated by PyMem_RawMalloc() or PyMem_RawRealloc() (or
  NULL if an error occurred), instead of a string allocated by
  PyMem_Malloc() or PyMem_Realloc().

- bpo-19199: Remove ``PyThreadState.tick_counter`` field

- Fix macro expansion of _PyErr_OCCURRED(), and make sure to use it in at
  least one place so as to avoid regressions.

- bpo-19087: Improve bytearray allocation in order to allow cheap popping of
  data at the front (slice deletion).

- bpo-19014: memoryview.cast() is now allowed on zero-length views.

- bpo-18690: memoryview is now automatically registered with
  collections.abc.Sequence

- bpo-19078: memoryview now correctly supports the reversed builtin (Patch
  by Claudiu Popa)

- Fix a reference count leak in _sre.

- bpo-19262: Initial check in of the 'asyncio' package (a.k.a. Tulip, a.k.a.
  PEP 3156). There are no docs yet, and the PEP is slightly out of date with
  the code. This module will have *provisional* status in Python 3.4.

- bpo-19276: Fixed the wave module on 64-bit big-endian platforms.

- bpo-19266: Rename the new-in-3.4 ``contextlib.ignore`` context manager to
  ``contextlib.suppress`` in order to be more consistent with existing
  descriptions of that operation elsewhere in the language and standard
  library documentation (Patch by Zero Piraeus).

- bpo-18891: Completed the new email package (provisional) API additions by
  adding new classes EmailMessage, MIMEPart, and ContentManager.

- bpo-18281: Unused stat constants removed from `tarfile`.

- bpo-18999: Multiprocessing now supports 'contexts' with the same API as
  the module, but bound to specified start methods.

- bpo-18468: The re.split, re.findall, and re.sub functions and the group()
  and groups() methods of match object now always return a string or a bytes
  object.

- bpo-18725: The textwrap module now supports truncating multiline text.

- bpo-18776: atexit callbacks now display their full traceback when they
  raise an exception.

  function.

- bpo-19131: The aifc module now correctly reads and writes sampwidth of
  compressed streams.

- bpo-19209: Remove import of copyreg from the os module to speed up
  interpreter startup. stat_result and statvfs_result are now hard-coded to
  reside in the os module.

- bpo-19205: Don't import the 're' module in site and sysconfig module to
  speed up interpreter start.

- bpo-9548: Add a minimal "_bootlocale" module that is imported by the _io
  module instead of the full locale module.

- bpo-18764: Remove the 'print' alias for the PDB 'p' command so that it no
  longer shadows the print function.

- bpo-19158: A rare race in BoundedSemaphore could allow .release() too
  often.

- bpo-15805: Add contextlib.redirect_stdout().

- bpo-18716: Deprecate the formatter module.

- bpo-10712: 2to3 has a new "asserts" fixer that replaces deprecated names
  of unittest methods (e.g. failUnlessEqual -> assertEqual).

- bpo-18037: 2to3 now escapes ``'\u'`` and ``'\U'`` in native strings.

- bpo-17839: base64.decodebytes and base64.encodebytes now accept any object
  that exports a 1 dimensional array of bytes (this means the same is now
  also true for base64_codec)

- bpo-19132: The pprint module now supports compact mode.

- bpo-19137: The pprint module now correctly formats instances of set and
  frozenset subclasses.

- bpo-10042: functools.total_ordering now correctly handles NotImplemented
  being returned by the underlying comparison function (Patch by Katie
  Miller)

- bpo-19092: contextlib.ExitStack now correctly reraises exceptions from the
  __exit__ callbacks of inner context managers (Patch by Hrvoje Nikšić)

- bpo-12641: Avoid passing "-mno-cygwin" to the mingw32 compiler, except
  when necessary. Patch by Oscar Benjamin.

- bpo-5845: In site.py, only load readline history from ~/.python_history if
  no history has been read already.  This avoids double writes to the
  history file at shutdown.

- Properly initialize all fields of a SSL object after allocation.

- bpo-19095: SSLSocket.getpeercert() now raises ValueError when the SSL
  handshake hasn't been done.

- bpo-4366: Fix building extensions on all platforms when --enable-shared is
  used.

- bpo-19030: Fixed `inspect.getmembers` and `inspect.classify_class_attrs`
  to attempt activating descriptors before falling back to a __dict__ search
  for faulty descriptors.  `inspect.classify_class_attrs` no longer returns
  Attributes whose home class is None.

C API
-----

- bpo-1772673: The type of `char*` arguments now changed to `const char*`.

- bpo-16129: Added a `Py_SetStandardStreamEncoding` pre-initialization API
  to allow embedding applications like Blender to force a particular
  encoding and error handler for the standard IO streams (initial patch by
  Bastien Montagne)

Tests
-----

- bpo-19275: Fix test_site on AMD64 Snow Leopard

- bpo-14407: Fix unittest test discovery in test_concurrent_futures.

- bpo-18919: Unified and extended tests for audio modules: aifc, sunau and
  wave.

- bpo-18972: Modernize email examples and use the argparse module in them.

Build
-----

- bpo-19130: Correct PCbuild/readme.txt, Python 3.3 and 3.4 require VS 2010.

- bpo-15663: Update OS X 10.6+ installer to use Tcl/Tk 8.5.15.

- bpo-14499: Fix several problems with OS X universal build support:   1.
  ppc arch detection for extension module builds broke with Xcode 5   2. ppc
  arch detection in configure did not work on OS X 10.4   3. -sysroot and
  -arch flags were unnecessarily duplicated   4. there was no obvious way to
  configure an intel-32 only build.

- bpo-19019: Change the OS X installer build script to use CFLAGS instead of
  OPT for special build options.  By setting OPT, some compiler-specific
  options like -fwrapv were overridden and thus not used, which could result
  in broken interpreters when building with clang.


What's New in Python 3.4.0 alpha 3?
===================================

Core and Builtins
-----------------

  Au_read.readframes() now updates current file position and reads correct
  number of frames from multichannel stream.  Au_write.writeframesraw() now
  correctly updates current file position.  Au_read.getnframes() now returns
  an integer (as in Python 2). Au_read and Au_write now correctly works with
  file object if start file position is not a zero.

- bpo-18594: The fast path for collections.Counter() was never taken due to
  an over- restrictive type check.

- bpo-19037: The mailbox module now makes all changes to maildir files
  before moving them into place, to avoid race conditions with other
  programs that may be accessing the maildir directory.

- bpo-14984: On POSIX systems, when netrc is called without a filename
  argument (and therefore is reading the user's $HOME/.netrc file), it now
  enforces the same security rules as typical ftp clients: the .netrc file
  must be owned by the user that owns the process and must not be readable
  by any other user.

- bpo-18873: The tokenize module now detects Python source code encoding
  only in comment lines.

- bpo-17764: Enable http.server to bind to a user specified network

  the underlying iterables.

- bpo-18784: The uuid module no longer attempts to load libc via ctypes.CDLL
  if all the necessary functions have already been found in libuuid.  Patch
  by Evgeny Sologubov.

- The :envvar:`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER` environment variable now only enables the
  faulthandler module if the variable is non-empty. Same behaviour than

  int (displays value of int-subclass instead of str(int-subclass) ).

Library
-------

- bpo-18808: Thread.join() now waits for the underlying thread state to be
  destroyed before returning.  This prevents unpredictable aborts in
  Py_EndInterpreter() when some non-daemon threads are still running.

- bpo-18458: Prevent crashes with newer versions of libedit.  Its readline
  emulation has changed from 0-based indexing to 1-based like gnu readline.

- bpo-18852: Handle case of ``readline.__doc__`` being ``None`` in the new
  readline activation code in ``site.py``.

- bpo-18672: Fixed format specifiers for Py_ssize_t in debugging output in
  the _sre module.

- bpo-18830: inspect.getclasstree() no longer produces duplicate entries
  even when input list contains duplicates.

- bpo-18878: sunau.open now supports the context management protocol.  Based
  on patches by Claudiu Popa and R. David Murray.

- bpo-18909: Fix _tkinter.tkapp.interpaddr() on Windows 64-bit, don't cast
  64-bit pointer to long (32 bits).

  under which the file was opened.  Patch by Erik Bray.

- bpo-16853: Add new selectors module.

- bpo-18882: Add threading.main_thread() function.

- bpo-18901: The sunau getparams method now returns a namedtuple rather than
  a plain tuple.  Patch by Claudiu Popa.

- bpo-17487: The result of the wave getparams method now is pickleable
  again. Patch by Claudiu Popa.

- bpo-18756: os.urandom() now uses a lazily-opened persistent file
  descriptor, so as to avoid using many file descriptors when run in
  parallel from multiple threads.

- bpo-18418: After fork(), reinit all threads states, not only active ones.
  Patch by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis.

- bpo-17974: Switch unittest from using getopt to using argparse.

- bpo-11798: TestSuite now drops references to own tests after execution.

- bpo-16611: http.cookie now correctly parses the 'secure' and 'httponly'
  cookie flags.

  supersedes the previous fixes for #14360, #1717, and #16564.

- bpo-18794: Add a fileno() method and a closed attribute to select.devpoll
  objects.

- bpo-17119: Fixed integer overflows when processing large strings and
  tuples in the tkinter module.

- bpo-18747: Re-seed OpenSSL's pseudo-random number generator after fork. A
  pthread_atfork() parent handler is used to seed the PRNG with pid, time
  and some stack data.

- bpo-8865: Concurrent invocation of select.poll.poll() now raises a
  RuntimeError exception.  Patch by Christian Schubert.

- bpo-18777: The ssl module now uses the new CRYPTO_THREADID API of OpenSSL
  1.0.0+ instead of the deprecated CRYPTO id callback function.

- bpo-18178: Fix ctypes on BSD. dlmalloc.c was compiled twice which broke
  malloc weak symbols.

- bpo-18709: Fix CVE-2013-4238. The SSL module now handles NULL bytes inside
  subjectAltName correctly. Formerly the module has used OpenSSL's
  GENERAL_NAME_print() function to get the string represention of ASN.1
  strings for ``rfc822Name`` (email), ``dNSName`` (DNS) and
  ``uniformResourceIdentifier`` (URI).

- bpo-18701: Remove support of old CPython versions (<3.0) from C code.

- bpo-18756: Improve error reporting in os.urandom() when the failure is due
  to something else than /dev/urandom not existing (for example, exhausting
  the file descriptor limit).

- bpo-18673: Add O_TMPFILE to os module. O_TMPFILE requires Linux kernel
  3.11 or newer. It's only defined on system with 3.11 uapi headers, too.

- bpo-18532: Change the builtin hash algorithms' names to lower case names
  as promised by hashlib's documentation.

  get_all_start_methods, get_start_method, and set_start_method, to
  multiprocessing.

- bpo-18405: Improve the entropy of crypt.mksalt().

- bpo-12015: The tempfile module now uses a suffix of 8 random characters
  instead of 6, to reduce the risk of filename collision. The entropy was
  reduced when uppercase letters were removed from the charset used to
  generate random characters.

- bpo-18585: Add :func:`textwrap.shorten` to collapse and truncate a piece
  of text to a given length.

- bpo-18598: Tweak exception message for importlib.import_module() to
  include the module name when a key argument is missing.

  reflect 2-tuples.

- bpo-19152: Add ExtensionFileLoader.get_filename().

- bpo-18676: Change 'positive' to 'non-negative' in queue.py put and get
  docstrings and ValueError messages. Patch by Zhongyue Luo

- Fix refcounting issue with extension types in tkinter.

- bpo-8112: xlmrpc.server's DocXMLRPCServer server no longer raises an error
  if methods have annotations; it now correctly displays the annotations.

  as_bytes and __bytes__ methods to Message.

- bpo-18671: Output more information when logging exceptions occur.

- bpo-18621: Prevent the site module's patched builtins from keeping too
  many references alive for too long.

- bpo-4885: Add weakref support to mmap objects.  Patch by Valerie Lambert.

- bpo-8860: Fixed rounding in timedelta constructor.

- bpo-18849: Fixed a Windows-specific tempfile bug where collision with an
  existing directory caused mkstemp and related APIs to fail instead of
  retrying. Report and fix by Vlad Shcherbina.

- bpo-18920: argparse's default destination for the version action (-v,
  --version) has also been changed to stdout, to match the Python
  executable.

Tests
-----

- bpo-18623: Factor out the _SuppressCoreFiles context manager into
  test.support.  Patch by Valerie Lambert.

- bpo-12037: Fix test_email for desktop Windows.

- bpo-15507: test_subprocess's test_send_signal could fail if the test
  runner were run in an environment where the process inherited an ignore
  setting for SIGINT. Restore the SIGINT handler to the desired
  KeyboardInterrupt raising one during that test.

- bpo-16799: Switched from getopt to argparse style in regrtest's argument
  parsing. Added more tests for regrtest's argument parsing.

- bpo-18792: Use "127.0.0.1" or "::1" instead of "localhost" as much as
  possible, since "localhost" goes through a DNS lookup under recent Windows
  versions.

IDLE
----

- bpo-18489: Add tests for SearchEngine. Original patch by Phil Webster.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-18743: Fix references to non-existant "StringIO" module.

  error messages and comments.

Build
-----

- bpo-1584: Provide configure options to override default search paths for
  Tcl and Tk when building _tkinter.

- bpo-15663: Tcl/Tk 8.5.14 is now included with the OS X 10.6+ 64-/32-bit
  installer.  It is no longer necessary to install a third-party version of
  Tcl/Tk 8.5 to work around the problems in the Apple-supplied Tcl/Tk 8.5
  shipped in OS X 10.6 and later releases.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-18922: Now The Lib/smtpd.py and Tools/i18n/msgfmt.py scripts write
  their version strings to stdout, and not to sderr.

  the object could remain reachable through its weakref even though its
  refcount had dropped to zero.

- bpo-16495: Remove extraneous NULL encoding check from bytes_decode().

- bpo-16619: Create NameConstant AST class to represent None, True, and
  False literals. As a result, these constants are never loaded at runtime
  from builtins.

- bpo-16455: On FreeBSD and Solaris, if the locale is C, the
  ASCII/surrogateescape codec is now used (instead of the locale encoding)
  to decode the command line arguments. This change fixes inconsistencies
  with os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode(), because these operating systems
  announce an ASCII locale encoding, but actually use the ISO-8859-1
  encoding in practice.

  parameters where passed to the interpreter.  Patch by Hieu Nguyen.

- bpo-16215: Fix potential double memory free in str.replace().  Patch by
  Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-16290: A float return value from the __complex__ special method is no
  longer accepted in the complex() constructor.

- bpo-16416: On Mac OS X, operating system data are now always
  encoded/decoded to/from UTF-8/surrogateescape, instead of the locale
  encoding (which may be ASCII if no locale environment variable is set), to
  avoid inconsistencies with os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() functions which
  are already using UTF-8/surrogateescape.

- bpo-16453: Fix equality testing of dead weakref objects.

- bpo-9535: Fix pending signals that have been received but not yet handled
  by Python to not persist after os.fork() in the child process.

  Stinner.

- bpo-8271: the utf-8 decoder now outputs the correct number of U+FFFD
  characters when used with the 'replace' error handler on invalid utf-8
  sequences.  Patch by Serhiy Storchaka, tests by Ezio Melotti.

  raises an error.

- bpo-7317: Display full tracebacks when an error occurs asynchronously.
  Patch by Alon Horev with update by Alexey Kachayev.

  written by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-16345: Fix an infinite loop when ``fromkeys`` on a dict subclass
  received a nonempty dict from the constructor.

- bpo-16271: Fix strange bugs that resulted from __qualname__ appearing in a
  class's __dict__ and on type.

- bpo-12805: Make bytes.join and bytearray.join faster when the separator is
  empty. Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-6074: Ensure cached bytecode files can always be updated by the user
  that created them, even when the source file is read-only.

- bpo-15958: bytes.join and bytearray.join now accept arbitrary buffer
  objects.

  decoder (already working as unicode strings).  Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-15144: Fix possible integer overflow when handling pointers as integer
  values, by using `Py_uintptr_t` instead of `size_t`.  Patch by Serhiy
  Storchaka.

- bpo-15965: Explicitly cast `AT_FDCWD` as (int).  Required on Solaris 10
  (which defines `AT_FDCWD` as ``0xffd19553``), harmless on other platforms.

- bpo-15839: Convert SystemErrors in `super()` to RuntimeErrors.

- bpo-15448: Buffered IO now frees the buffer when closed, instead of when
  deallocating.

- bpo-15846: Fix SystemError which happened when using `ast.parse()` in an
  exception handler on code with syntax errors.

- bpo-15897: zipimport.c doesn't check return value of fseek(). Patch by
  Felipe Cruz.

- bpo-15801: Make sure mappings passed to '%' formatting are actually
  subscriptable.

-----------------

- bpo-16046: Fix loading sourceless legacy .pyo files.

- bpo-16060: Fix refcounting bug when `__trunc__()` returns an object whose
  `__int__()` gives a non-integer.  Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

Library
-------

- bpo-16012: Fix a regression in pyexpat. The parser's `UseForeignDTD()`
  method doesn't require an argument again.


What's New in Python 3.3.0 release candidate 3?
===============================================

*Release date: 23-Sep-2012*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-15900: Fix reference leak in `PyUnicode_TranslateCharmap()`.

- bpo-15926: Fix crash after multiple reinitializations of the interpreter.

- bpo-15895: Fix FILE pointer leak in one error branch of
  `PyRun_SimpleFileExFlags()` when filename points to a pyc/pyo file,
  closeit is false an and set_main_loader() fails.

- Fixes for a few crash and memory leak regressions found by Coverity.

Library
-------

- bpo-15882: Change `_decimal` to accept any coefficient tuple when
  constructing infinities. This is done for backwards compatibility with
  decimal.py: Infinity coefficients are undefined in _decimal (in accordance
  with the specification).

- bpo-15925: Fix a regression in `email.util` where the `parsedate()` and
  `parsedate_tz()` functions did not return None anymore when the argument
  could not be parsed.

- bpo-15973: Fix a segmentation fault when comparing datetime timezone
  objects.

  dump_traceback_later() and cancel_dump_tracebacks_later() to
  cancel_dump_traceback_later().

- _decimal module: use only C 89 style comments.


What's New in Python 3.3.0 release candidate 2?
===============================================

*Release date: 09-Sep-2012*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-13992: The trashcan mechanism is now thread-safe.  This eliminates
  sporadic crashes in multi-thread programs when several long deallocator
  chains ran concurrently and involved subclasses of built-in container
  types.

- bpo-15784: Modify `OSError`.__str__() to better distinguish between errno
  error numbers and Windows error numbers.

- bpo-15781: Fix two small race conditions in import's module locking.

Library
-------

- bpo-17158: Add 'symbols' to help() welcome message; clarify 'modules spam'
  messages.

  argument lists anymore.

- bpo-15828: Restore support for C extensions in `imp.load_module()`.

- bpo-15340: Fix importing the random module when ``/dev/urandom`` cannot be
  opened. This was a regression caused by the hash randomization patch.

- bpo-10650: Deprecate the watchexp parameter of the `Decimal.quantize()`
  method.

- bpo-15785: Modify `window.get_wch()` API of the curses module: return a
  character for most keys, and an integer for special keys, instead of
  always returning an integer. So it is now possible to distinguish special
  keys like keypad keys.

- bpo-14223: Fix `window.addch()` of the curses module for special
  characters like curses.ACS_HLINE: the Python function addch(int) and
  addch(bytes) is now calling the C function waddch()/mvwaddch() (as it was
  done in Python 3.2), instead of wadd_wch()/mvwadd_wch(). The Python
  function addch(str) is still calling the C function
  wadd_wch()/mvwadd_wch() if the Python curses is linked to libncursesw.

Build
-----

- bpo-15822: Really ensure 2to3 grammar pickles are properly installed
  (replaces fixes for Issue #15645).

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-15814: The memoryview enhancements in 3.3.0 accidentally permitted the
  hashing of multi-dimensional memorviews and memoryviews with multi-byte
  item formats. The intended restrictions have now been documented - they
  will be correctly enforced in 3.3.1.

  msg isn't a str.

- bpo-2051: Source file permission bits are once again correctly copied to
  the cached bytecode file. (The migration to importlib reintroduced this
  problem because these was no regression test. A test has been added as
  part of this patch)

- bpo-15761: Fix crash when ``PYTHONEXECUTABLE`` is set on Mac OS X.

- bpo-15726: Fix incorrect bounds checking in PyState_FindModule.  Patch by

  specifier.

- bpo-15595: Fix ``subprocess.Popen(universal_newlines=True)`` for certain
  locales (utf-16 and utf-32 family). Patch by Chris Jerdonek.

- bpo-15477: In cmath and math modules, add workaround for platforms whose

  Patch by Chris Rebert.

- Create a 'Concurrent Execution' section in the docs, and split up the
  'Optional Operating System Services' section to use a more user-centric
  classification scheme (splitting them across the new CE section, IPC and
  text processing). Operating system limitations can be reflected with the
  Sphinx ``:platform:`` tag, it doesn't make sense as part of the Table of
  Contents.

- bpo-4966: Bring the sequence docs up to date for the Py3k transition and
  the many language enhancements since they were original written.

  distutils.unixccompiler into a new module _osx_support.

C API
-----

- bpo-15610: `PyImport_ImportModuleEx()` now uses a 'level' of 0 instead of
  -1.

- bpo-15169: Strip out the C implementation of `imp.source_from_cache()`
  used by PyImport_ExecCodeModuleWithPathnames() and used the Python code

-----------------

- Fix a (most likely) very rare memory leak when calling main() and not
  being able to decode a command-line argument.

- bpo-14815: Use Py_ssize_t instead of long for the object hash, to preserve
  all 64 bits of hash on Win64.

- bpo-12268: File readline, readlines and read() or readall() methods no
  longer lose data when an underlying read system call is interrupted.
  IOError is no longer raised due to a read system call returning EINTR from
  within these methods.

- bpo-11626: Add _SizeT functions to stable ABI.

- bpo-15142: Fix reference leak when deallocating instances of types created
  using PyType_FromSpec().

  locale.setlocale(), use the current locale encoding instead of the user
  preferred encoding.

- bpo-14673: Add Eric Snow's sys.implementation implementation.

- bpo-15038: Optimize python Locks on Windows.

Library

  Many functions now support "dir_fd" and "follow_symlinks" parameters; some
  also support accepting an open file descriptor in place of a path string.
  Added os.support_* collections as LBYL helpers.  Removed many functions
  only previously seen in 3.3 alpha releases (often starting with "f" or

- LZMAFile now accepts the modes "rb"/"wb"/"ab" as synonyms of "r"/"w"/"a".

- The bz2 and lzma modules now each contain an open() function, allowing
  compressed files to readily be opened in text mode as well as binary mode.

- BZ2File.__init__() and LZMAFile.__init__() now accept a file object as
  their first argument, rather than requiring a separate "fileobj" argument.

- gzip.open() now accepts file objects as well as filenames.

- bpo-14992: os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True) would raise an OSError when

  implementation have either been removed or marked as private interfaces.

Library
-------

  options.  Patch by Roger Serwy.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-15176: Clarified behavior, documentation, and implementation of
  os.listdir().

- bpo-14982: Document that pkgutil's iteration functions require the non-
  standard iter_modules() method to be defined by an importer (something the
  importlib importers do not define).

- bpo-15081: Document PyState_FindModule. Patch by Robin Schreiber.

- bpo-14814: Added first draft of ipaddress module API reference

Tests
-----

- bpo-15187: Bugfix: remove temporary directories test_shutil was leaving
  behind.

  "parity" between PyArg_ParseTuple() and the Python/getargs.c static
  function skipitem() for all possible "format units".

- test_nntplib now tolerates being run from behind NNTP gateways that add
  "X-Antivirus" headers to articles

- bpo-15043: test_gdb is now skipped entirely if gdb security settings block
  loading of the gdb hooks

- bpo-14963: Add test cases for exception handling behaviour in
  contextlib.ExitStack (Initial patch by Alon Horev)

Build
-----

- bpo-13590: Improve support for OS X Xcode 4:   * Try to avoid building
  Python or extension modules with problematic     llvm-gcc compiler.   *
  Since Xcode 4 removes ppc support, extension module builds now     check
  for ppc compiler support and automatically remove ppc and     ppc64 archs
  when not available. * Since Xcode 4 no longer install SDKs in default
  locations,     extension module builds now revert to using installed
  headers     and libs if the SDK used to build the interpreter is not
  available.   * Update ./configure to use better defaults for universal
  builds;     in particular, --enable- universalsdk=yes uses the Xcode
  default     SDK and --with-universal-archs now defaults to "intel" if ppc
  not available.

- bpo-14225: Fix Unicode support for curses (#12567) on OS X

- bpo-14928: Fix importlib bootstrap issues by using a custom executable
  (Modules/_freeze_importlib) to build Python/importlib.h.

  os.lutimes(), and os.futimes() now accept a new parameter, ns, which
  accepts mtime and atime as integers with nanosecond resolution.

- bpo-14127: shutil.copystat now preserves exact mtime and atime on
  filesystems providing nanosecond resolution. (See also: bpo-10148)

  in Python 3.3a1.

- bpo-14168: Check for presence of Element._attrs in minidom before
  accessing it.

- bpo-12328: Fix multiprocessing's use of overlapped I/O on Windows. Also,

  polling multiple objects at once.  Patch by sbt.

- bpo-14007: Accept incomplete TreeBuilder objects (missing start, end, data
  or close method) for the Python implementation as well. Drop the no-op
  TreeBuilder().xml() method from the C implementation.

What's New in Python 3.3.0 alpha 1?
===================================

*Release date: 05-Mar-2012*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-14172: Fix reference leak when marshalling a buffer-like object (other
  than a bytes object).

- bpo-13521: dict.setdefault() now does only one lookup for the given key,
  making it "atomic" for many purposes.  Patch by Filip Gruszczyński.

- PEP 409, Issue #6210: "raise X from None" is now supported as a means of
  suppressing the display of the chained exception context. The chained
  context still remains available as the __context__ attribute.

- bpo-10181: New memoryview implementation fixes multiple ownership and
  lifetime issues of dynamically allocated Py_buffer members (#9990) as well
  as crashes (#8305, #7433). Many new features have been added (See
  whatsnew/3.3), and the documentation has been updated extensively. The
  ndarray test object from _testbuffer.c implements all aspects of PEP-3118,
  so further development towards the complete implementation of the PEP can
  proceed in a test-driven manner.

  Thanks to Nick Coghlan, Antoine Pitrou and Pauli Virtanen for review and
  many ideas.

- bpo-12834: Fix incorrect results of memoryview.tobytes() for non-
  contiguous arrays.

- bpo-5231: Introduce memoryview.cast() method that allows changing format
  and shape without making a copy of the underlying memory.

- bpo-14084: Fix a file descriptor leak when importing a module with a bad
  encoding.

- Upgrade Unicode data to Unicode 6.1.

- bpo-14040: Remove rarely used file name suffixes for C extensions (under
  POSIX mainly).

- bpo-14051: Allow arbitrary attributes to be set of classmethod and
  staticmethod.

- bpo-13703: oCERT-2011-003: Randomize hashes of str and bytes to protect
  against denial of service attacks due to hash collisions within the dict
  and set types. Patch by David Malcolm, based on work by Victor Stinner.

- bpo-13020: Fix a reference leak when allocating a structsequence object
  fails.  Patch by Suman Saha.

- bpo-13908: Ready types returned from PyType_FromSpec.

- bpo-11235: Fix OverflowError when trying to import a source file whose
  modification time doesn't fit in a 32-bit timestamp.

- bpo-12705: A SyntaxError exception is now raised when attempting to
  compile multiple statements as a single interactive statement.

- Fix the builtin module initialization code to store the init function for
  future reinitialization.

- bpo-8052: The posix subprocess module would take a long time closing all
  possible file descriptors in the child process rather than just open file
  descriptors.  It now closes only the open fds if possible for the default
  close_fds=True behavior.

- bpo-13629: Renumber the tokens in token.h so that they match the indexes
  into _PyParser_TokenNames.

- bpo-13752: Add a casefold() method to str.

- bpo-13761: Add a "flush" keyword argument to the print() function, used to
  ensure flushing the output stream.

- bpo-13645: pyc files now contain the size of the corresponding source
  code, to avoid timestamp collisions (especially on filesystems with a low
  timestamp resolution) when checking for freshness of the bytecode.

- PEP 380, Issue #11682: Add "yield from <x>" to support easy delegation to
  subgenerators (initial patch by Greg Ewing, integration into 3.3 by Renaud
  Blanch, Ryan Kelly, Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek and Nick Coghlan)

- bpo-13748: Raw bytes literals can now be written with the ``rb`` prefix as
  well as ``br``.

- bpo-12736: Use full unicode case mappings for upper, lower, and title
  case.

- bpo-12760: Add a create mode to open(). Patch by David Townshend.

- bpo-13738: Simplify implementation of bytes.lower() and bytes.upper().

- bpo-13577: Built-in methods and functions now have a __qualname__. Patch
  by sbt.

- bpo-6695: Full garbage collection runs now clear the freelist of set
  objects.  Initial patch by Matthias Troffaes.

- Fix OSError.__init__ and OSError.__new__ so that each of them can be
  overriden and take additional arguments (followup to issue #12555).

- Fix the fix for issue #12149: it was incorrect, although it had the side
  effect of appearing to resolve the issue.  Thanks to Mark Shannon for
  noticing.

- bpo-13505: Pickle bytes objects in a way that is compatible with Python 2
  when using protocols <= 2.

- bpo-11147: Fix an unused argument in _Py_ANNOTATE_MEMORY_ORDER.  (Fix
  given by Campbell Barton).

- bpo-13503: Use a more efficient reduction format for bytearrays with
  pickle protocol >= 3.  The old reduction format is kept with older
  protocols in order to allow unpickling under Python 2.  Patch by Irmen de
  Jong.

- bpo-7111: Python can now be run without a stdin, stdout or stderr stream.
  It was already the case with Python 2.  However, the corresponding sys
  module entries are now set to None (instead of an unusable file object).

- bpo-11849: Ensure that free()d memory arenas are really released on POSIX
  systems supporting anonymous memory mappings.  Patch by Charles-François
  Natali.

- PEP 3155 / issue #13448: Qualified name for classes and functions.

- bpo-13436: Fix a bogus error message when an AST object was passed an
  invalid integer value.

- bpo-13411: memoryview objects are now hashable when the underlying object
  is hashable.

- bpo-13338: Handle all enumerations in _Py_ANNOTATE_MEMORY_ORDER to allow
  compiling extension modules with -Wswitch-enum on gcc. Initial patch by
  Floris Bruynooghe.

- bpo-10227: Add an allocation cache for a single slice object.  Patch by
  Stefan Behnel.

- bpo-13393: BufferedReader.read1() now asks the full requested size to the
  raw stream instead of limiting itself to the buffer size.

- bpo-13392: Writing a pyc file should now be atomic under Windows as well.

- bpo-13333: The UTF-7 decoder now accepts lone surrogates (the encoder
  already accepts them).

- bpo-13389: Full garbage collection passes now clear the freelists for list
  and dict objects.  They already cleared other freelists in the
  interpreter.

- bpo-13327: Remove the need for an explicit None as the second argument to
  os.utime, os.lutimes, os.futimes, os.futimens, os.futimesat, in order to
  update to the current time. Also added keyword argument handling to
  os.utimensat in order to remove the need for explicit None.

- bpo-13350: Simplify some C code by replacing most usages of
  PyUnicode_Format by PyUnicode_FromFormat.

- bpo-13342: input() used to ignore sys.stdin's and sys.stdout's unicode
  error handler in interactive mode (when calling into PyOS_Readline()).

- bpo-9896: Add start, stop, and step attributes to range objects.

- bpo-13343: Fix a SystemError when a lambda expression uses a global
  variable in the default value of a keyword-only argument: ``lambda *,
  arg=GLOBAL_NAME: None``

- bpo-12797: Added custom opener parameter to builtin open() and
  FileIO.open().

- bpo-10519: Avoid unnecessary recursive function calls in setobject.c.

- bpo-10363: Deallocate global locks in Py_Finalize().

- bpo-13018: Fix reference leaks in error paths in dictobject.c. Patch by
  Suman Saha.

- bpo-13201: Define '==' and '!=' to compare range objects based on the
  sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object
  identity).

- bpo-1294232: In a few cases involving metaclass inheritance, the
  interpreter would sometimes invoke the wrong metaclass when building a new
  class object. These cases now behave correctly. Patch by Daniel Urban.

- bpo-12753: Add support for Unicode name aliases and named sequences. Both
  ``unicodedata.lookup()`` and '\N{...}' now resolve aliases, and
  ``unicodedata.lookup()`` resolves named sequences too.

- bpo-12170: The count(), find(), rfind(), index() and rindex() methods of
  bytes and bytearray objects now accept an integer between 0 and 255 as
  their first argument.  Patch by Petri Lehtinen.

- bpo-12604: VTRACE macro expanded to no-op in _sre.c to avoid compiler
  warnings. Patch by Josh Triplett and Petri Lehtinen.

- bpo-12281: Rewrite the MBCS codec to handle correctly replace and ignore
  error handlers on all Windows versions. The MBCS codec is now supporting
  all error handlers, instead of only replace to encode and ignore to
  decode.

- bpo-13188: When called without an explicit traceback argument,
  generator.throw() now gets the traceback from the passed exception's
  ``__traceback__`` attribute. Patch by Petri Lehtinen.

- bpo-13146: Writing a pyc file is now atomic under POSIX.

- bpo-7833: Extension modules built using distutils on Windows will no
  longer include a "manifest" to prevent them failing at import time in some
  embedded situations.

- PEP 3151 / issue #12555: reworking the OS and IO exception hierarchy.

- Add internal API for static strings (_Py_identifier et al.).

- bpo-13063: the Windows error ERROR_NO_DATA (numbered 232 and described as
  "The pipe is being closed") is now mapped to POSIX errno EPIPE (previously
  EINVAL).

- bpo-12911: Fix memory consumption when calculating the repr() of huge
  tuples or lists.

- PEP 393: flexible string representation. Thanks to Torsten Becker for the
  initial implementation, and Victor Stinner for various bug fixes.

- bpo-14081: The 'sep' and 'maxsplit' parameter to str.split, bytes.split,
  and bytearray.split may now be passed as keyword arguments.

- bpo-13012: The 'keepends' parameter to str.splitlines may now be passed as
  a keyword argument: "my_string.splitlines(keepends=True)".  The same
  change also applies to bytes.splitlines and bytearray.splitlines.

- bpo-7732: Don't open a directory as a file anymore while importing a
  module. Ignore the direcotry if its name matchs the module name (e.g.
  "__init__.py") and raise a ImportError instead.

- bpo-13021: Missing decref on an error path.  Thanks to Suman Saha for
  finding the bug and providing a patch.

- bpo-12973: Fix overflow checks that relied on undefined behaviour in
  list_repeat (listobject.c) and islice_next (itertoolsmodule.c).  These
  bugs caused test failures with recent versions of Clang.

- bpo-12904: os.utime, os.futimes, os.lutimes, and os.futimesat now write
  atime and mtime with nanosecond precision on modern POSIX platforms.

- bpo-12802: the Windows error ERROR_DIRECTORY (numbered 267) is now mapped
  to POSIX errno ENOTDIR (previously EINVAL).

- bpo-9200: The str.is* methods now work with strings that contain non-BMP
  characters even in narrow Unicode builds.

- bpo-12791: Break reference cycles early when a generator exits with an
  exception.

- bpo-12773: Make __doc__ mutable on user-defined classes.

- bpo-12766: Raise a ValueError when creating a class with a class variable
  that conflicts with a name in __slots__.

- bpo-12266: Fix str.capitalize() to correctly uppercase/lowercase
  titlecased and cased non-letter characters.

- bpo-12732: In narrow unicode builds, allow Unicode identifiers which fall
  outside the BMP.

- bpo-12575: Validate user-generated AST before it is compiled.

- Make type(None), type(Ellipsis), and type(NotImplemented) callable. They
  return the respective singleton instances.

- Forbid summing bytes with sum().

- Verify the types of AST strings and identifiers provided by the user
  before compiling them.

- bpo-12647: The None object now has a __bool__() method that returns False.
  Formerly, bool(None) returned False only because of special case logic in
  PyObject_IsTrue().

- bpo-12579: str.format_map() now raises a ValueError if used on a format
  string that contains positional fields. Initial patch by Julian Berman.

- bpo-10271: Allow warnings.showwarning() be any callable.

- bpo-11627: Fix segfault when __new__ on a exception returns a non-
  exception class.

- bpo-12149: Update the method cache after a type's dictionary gets cleared
  by the garbage collector.  This fixes a segfault when an instance and its
  type get caught in a reference cycle, and the instance's deallocator calls
  one of the methods on the type (e.g. when subclassing IOBase).  Diagnosis
  and patch by Davide Rizzo.

- bpo-9611: FileIO.read() clamps the length to INT_MAX on Windows. (See
  also: bpo-9015)

- bpo-9642: Uniformize the tests on the availability of the mbcs codec, add
  a new HAVE_MBCS define.

- bpo-9642: Fix filesystem encoding initialization: use the ANSI code page
  on Windows if the mbcs codec is not available, and fail with a fatal error
  if we cannot get the locale encoding (if nl_langinfo(CODESET) is not
  available) instead of using UTF-8.

- When a generator yields, do not retain the caller's exception state on the
  generator.

- bpo-12475: Prevent generators from leaking their exception state into the
  caller's frame as they return for the last time.

- bpo-12291: You can now load multiple marshalled objects from a stream,
  with other data interleaved between marshalled objects.

- bpo-12356: When required positional or keyword-only arguments are not
  given, produce a informative error message which includes the name(s) of
  the missing arguments.

- bpo-12370: Fix super with no arguments when __class__ is overriden in the
  class body.

- bpo-12084: os.stat on Windows now works properly with relative symbolic
  links when called from any directory.

- Loosen type restrictions on the __dir__ method. __dir__ can now return any
  sequence, which will be converted to a list and sorted by dir().

- bpo-12265: Make error messages produced by passing an invalid set of
  arguments to a function more informative.

- bpo-12225: Still allow Python to build if Python is not in its hg repo or
  mercurial is not installed.

- bpo-1195: my_fgets() now always clears errors before calling fgets(). Fix
  the following case: sys.stdin.read() stopped with CTRL+d (end of file),
  raw_input() interrupted by CTRL+c.

- bpo-12216: Allow unexpected EOF errors to happen on any line of the file.

- bpo-12199: The TryExcept and TryFinally and AST nodes have been unified
  into a Try node.

- bpo-9670: Increase the default stack size for secondary threads on Mac OS
  X and FreeBSD to reduce the chances of a crash instead of a "maximum
  recursion depth" RuntimeError exception. (patch by Ronald Oussoren)

- bpo-12106: The use of the multiple-with shorthand syntax is now reflected
  in the AST.

- bpo-12190: Try to use the same filename object when compiling
  unmarshalling a code objects in the same file.

- bpo-12166: Move implementations of dir() specialized for various types
  into the __dir__() methods of those types.

- bpo-5715: In socketserver, close the server socket in the child process.

- Correct lookup of __dir__ on objects. Among other things, this causes
  errors besides AttributeError found on lookup to be propagated.

- bpo-12060: Use sig_atomic_t type and volatile keyword in the signal
  module. Patch written by Charles-François Natali.

- bpo-1746656: Added the if_nameindex, if_indextoname, if_nametoindex
  methods to the socket module.

- bpo-12044: Fixed subprocess.Popen when used as a context manager to wait
  for the process to end when exiting the context to avoid unintentionally
  leaving zombie processes around.

- bpo-1195: Fix input() if it is interrupted by CTRL+d and then CTRL+c,
  clear the end- of-file indicator after CTRL+d.

- bpo-1856: Avoid crashes and lockups when daemon threads run while the
  interpreter is shutting down; instead, these threads are now killed when
  they try to take the GIL.

- bpo-9756: When calling a method descriptor or a slot wrapper descriptor,
  the check of the object type doesn't read the __class__ attribute anymore.
  Fix a crash if a class override its __class__ attribute (e.g. a proxy of
  the str type). Patch written by Andreas Stührk.

- bpo-10517: After fork(), reinitialize the TLS used by the PyGILState_*
  APIs, to avoid a crash with the pthread implementation in RHEL 5.  Patch
  by Charles-François Natali.

- bpo-10914: Initialize correctly the filesystem codec when creating a new
  subinterpreter to fix a bootstrap issue with codecs implemented in Python,
  as the ISO-8859-15 codec.

- bpo-11918: OS/2 and VMS are no more supported because of the lack of
  maintainer.

- bpo-6780: fix starts/endswith error message to mention that tuples are
  accepted too.

- bpo-5057: fix a bug in the peepholer that led to non-portable pyc files
  between narrow and wide builds while optimizing BINARY_SUBSCR on non-BMP
  chars (e.g. "\U00012345"[0]).

- bpo-11845: Fix typo in rangeobject.c that caused a crash in
  compute_slice_indices. Patch by Daniel Urban.

- bpo-5673: Added a `timeout` keyword argument to subprocess.Popen.wait,
  subprocess.Popen.communicated, subprocess.call, subprocess.check_call, and
  subprocess.check_output.  If the blocking operation takes more than
  `timeout` seconds, the `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` exception is raised.

- bpo-11650: PyOS_StdioReadline() retries fgets() if it was interrupted
  (EINTR), for example if the program is stopped with CTRL+z on Mac OS X.
  Patch written by Charles-Francois Natali.

- bpo-9319: Include the filename in "Non-UTF8 code ..." syntax error.

- bpo-10785: Store the filename as Unicode in the Python parser.

- bpo-11619: _PyImport_LoadDynamicModule() doesn't encode the path to bytes
  on Windows.

- bpo-10998: Remove mentions of -Q, sys.flags.division_warning and
  Py_DivisionWarningFlag left over from Python 2.

- bpo-11244: Remove an unnecessary peepholer check that was preventing
  negative zeros from being constant-folded properly.

- bpo-11395: io.FileIO().write() clamps the data length to 32,767 bytes on
  Windows if the file is a TTY to workaround a Windows bug. The Windows
  console returns an error (12: not enough space error) on writing into
  stdout if stdout mode is binary and the length is greater than 66,000
  bytes (or less, depending on heap usage).

- bpo-11320: fix bogus memory management in Modules/getpath.c, leading to a
  possible crash when calling Py_SetPath().

- bpo-11432: A bug was introduced in subprocess.Popen on posix systems with
  3.2.0 where the stdout or stderr file descriptor being the same as the
  stdin file descriptor would raise an exception. webbrowser.open would
  fail. fixed.

- bpo-9856: Change object.__format__ with a non-empty format string to be a
  DeprecationWarning. In 3.2 it was a PendingDeprecationWarning. In 3.4 it
  will be a TypeError.

- bpo-11244: The peephole optimizer is now able to constant-fold arbitrarily
  complex expressions.  This also fixes a 3.2 regression where operations
  involving negative numbers were not constant-folded.

- bpo-11450: Don't truncate hg version info in Py_GetBuildInfo() when there
  are many tags (e.g. when using mq).  Patch by Nadeem Vawda.

- bpo-11335: Fixed a memory leak in list.sort when the key function throws
  an exception.

- bpo-8923: When a string is encoded to UTF-8 in strict mode, the result is
  cached into the object. Examples: str.encode(), str.encode('utf-8'),
  PyUnicode_AsUTF8String() and PyUnicode_AsEncodedString(unicode, "utf-8",
  NULL).

- bpo-10829: Refactor PyUnicode_FromFormat(), use the same function to parse
  the format string in the 3 steps, fix crashs on invalid format strings.

- bpo-13007: whichdb should recognize gdbm 1.9 magic numbers.

- bpo-11286: Raise a ValueError from calling PyMemoryView_FromBuffer with a
  buffer struct having a NULL data pointer.

- bpo-11272: On Windows, input() strips '\r' (and not only '\n'), and
  sys.stdin uses universal newline (replace '\r\n' by '\n').

- bpo-11828: startswith and endswith now accept None as slice index. Patch
  by Torsten Becker.

- bpo-11168: Remove filename debug variable from PyEval_EvalFrameEx(). It
  encoded the Unicode filename to UTF-8, but the encoding fails on
  undecodable filename (on surrogate characters) which raises an unexpected
  UnicodeEncodeError on recursion limit.

- bpo-11187: Remove bootstrap code (use ASCII) of
  PyUnicode_AsEncodedString(), it was replaced by a better fallback (use the
  locale encoding) in PyUnicode_EncodeFSDefault().

- Check for NULL result in PyType_FromSpec.

- bpo-10516: New copy() and clear() methods for lists and bytearrays.

- bpo-11386: bytearray.pop() now throws IndexError when the bytearray is
  empty, instead of OverflowError.

- bpo-12380: The rjust, ljust and center methods of bytes and bytearray now
  accept a bytearray argument.

  packages with C extension modules may fail because Apple has removed
  gcc-4.2, the version used to build python.org 64-bit/32-bit Pythons.  If
  the user does not explicitly override the default C compiler by setting
  the CC environment variable, Distutils will now attempt to compile
  extension modules with clang if gcc-4.2 is required but not found. Also as
  a convenience, if the user does explicitly set CC, substitute its value as
  the default compiler in the Distutils LDSHARED configuration variable for
  OS X. (Note, the python.org 32-bit-only Pythons use gcc-4.0 and the 10.4u
  SDK, neither of which are available in Xcode 4.  This change does not
  attempt to override settings to support their use with Xcode 4.)

  os.get_terminal_size (low level) and shutil.get_terminal_size (high
  level). Patch by Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek.

- bpo-13845: On Windows, time.time() now uses GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()
  instead of ftime() to have a resolution of 100 ns instead of 1 ms (the
  clock accuracy is between 0.5 ms and 15 ms).

- bpo-13846: Add time.monotonic(), monotonic clock.

- bpo-8184: multiprocessing: On Windows, don't set SO_REUSEADDR on
  Connection sockets, and set FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE on named pipes,
  to make sure two listeners can't bind to the same socket/pipe (or any
  existing socket/pipe).

  the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be
  represented

- bpo-13772: In os.symlink() under Windows, do not try to guess the link
  target's type (file or directory).  The detection was buggy and made the

  return False when the event was set and cleared right after.

- bpo-9993: When the source and destination are on different filesystems,
  and the source is a symlink, shutil.move() now recreates a symlink on the
  destination instead of copying the file contents.  Patch by Jonathan
  Niehof and Hynek Schlawack.

- bpo-12926: Fix a bug in tarfile's link extraction.

- bpo-13696: Fix the 302 Relative URL Redirection problem.

  (except when SSLv2 is explicitly asked for).

- bpo-12715: Add an optional symlinks argument to shutil functions
  (copyfile, copymode, copystat, copy, copy2).  When that parameter is true,
  symlinks aren't dereferenced and the operation instead acts on the symlink
  itself (or creates one, if relevant).  Patch by Hynek Schlawack.

- Add a flags parameter to select.epoll.

- bpo-13626: Add support for SSL Diffie-Hellman key exchange, through the

- bpo-13248: Turn 3.2's PendingDeprecationWarning into 3.3's
  DeprecationWarning.  It covers 'cgi.escape', 'importlib.abc.PyLoader',
  'importlib.abc.PyPycLoader', 'nntplib.NNTP.xgtitle', 'nntplib.NNTP.xpath',
  and private attributes of 'smtpd.SMTPChannel'.

- bpo-5905: time.strftime() is now using the current locale encoding,
  instead of UTF-8, if the wcsftime() function is not available. (See also:
  bpo-13560)

  for filename generation in the tempfile module.  Patch by Brian Harring.

- bpo-9957: SpooledTemporaryFile.truncate() now accepts an optional size
  parameter, as other file-like objects.  Patch by Ryan Kelly.

  _multiprocessing.win32.WaitForMultipleObjects interruptible when the
  wait_flag parameter is false.  Patch by sbt.

- bpo-13322: Fix BufferedWriter.write() to ensure that BlockingIOError is
  raised when the wrapped raw file is non-blocking and the write would
  block. Previous code assumed that the raw write() would raise

  of crashing when an invalid path is given in the manifest template.

- bpo-12841: tarfile unnecessarily checked the existence of numerical user
  and group ids on extraction. If one of them did not exist the respective
  id of the current user (i.e. root) was used for the file and ownership
  information was lost.

- bpo-12888: Fix a bug in HTMLParser.unescape that prevented it to escape
  more than 128 entities.  Patch by Peter Otten.

  help('somebuiltin.somemethod') in Python code) now finds the doc of the
  method.

- bpo-10968: Remove indirection in threading.  The public names (Event,
  Condition, etc.) used to be factory functions returning instances of
  hidden classes (_Event, _Condition, etc.), because (if Guido recalls
  correctly) this code pre-dates the ability to subclass extension types.
  It is now possible to inherit from these classes, without having to import
  the private underscored names like multiprocessing did.

- bpo-9723: Add shlex.quote functions, to escape filenames and command
  lines.

  read1() method), and add a *write_through* parameter to mandate unbuffered
  writes.

- bpo-10883: Fix socket leaks in urllib.request when using FTP.

- bpo-12551: Provide a get_channel_binding() method on SSL sockets so as to
  get channel binding data for the current SSL session (only the "tls-
  unique" channel binding is implemented).  This allows the implementation
  of certain authentication mechanisms such as SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS.  Patch by
  Jacek Konieczny.

- bpo-665194: email.utils now has format_datetime and parsedate_to_datetime
  functions, allowing for round tripping of RFC2822 format dates.

- bpo-12571: Add a plat-linux3 directory mirroring the plat-linux2
  directory, so that "import DLFCN" and other similar imports work on Linux
  3.0.

- bpo-7484: smtplib no longer puts <> around addresses in VRFY and EXPN
  commands; they aren't required and in fact postfix doesn't support that
  form.

  checking sys.version_info or sys._mercurial.

- Silence spurious "broken pipe" tracebacks when shutting down a
  ProcessPoolExecutor.

- bpo-12502: asyncore: fix polling loop with AF_UNIX sockets.

- bpo-4376: ctypes now supports nested structures in a endian different than
  the parent structure. Patch by Vlad Riscutia.

- Raise ValueError when attempting to set the _CHUNK_SIZE attribute of a
  TextIOWrapper to a huge value, not TypeError.

- bpo-12504: Close file handles in a timely manner in packaging.database.
  This fixes a bug with the remove (uninstall) feature on Windows.

- bpo-12169: Factor out code used by various packaging commands to make HTTP
  POST requests, and make sure it uses CRLF. (See also: bpo-10510)

- bpo-12016: Multibyte CJK decoders now resynchronize faster. They only
  ignore the first byte of an invalid byte sequence. For example,
  b'\xff\n'.decode('gb2312', 'replace') gives '\ufffd\n' instead of
  '\ufffd'.

- bpo-12459: time.sleep() now raises a ValueError if the sleep length is
  negative, instead of an infinite sleep on Windows or raising an IOError on
  Linux for example, to have the same behaviour on all platforms.

- bpo-12451: pydoc: html_getfile() now uses tokenize.open() to support
  Python scripts using a encoding different than UTF-8 (read the coding
  cookie of the script).

- bpo-12493: subprocess: Popen.communicate() now also handles EINTR errors
  if the process has only one pipe.

- bpo-12467: warnings: fix a race condition if a warning is emitted at
  shutdown, if globals()['__file__'] is None.

- bpo-12451: pydoc: importfile() now opens the Python script in binary mode,
  instead of text mode using the locale encoding, to avoid encoding issues.

- bpo-12451: runpy: run_path() now opens the Python script in binary mode,
  instead of text mode using the locale encoding, to support other encodings
  than UTF-8 (scripts using the coding cookie).

- bpo-12451: xml.dom.pulldom: parse() now opens files in binary mode instead
  of the text mode (using the locale encoding) to avoid encoding issues.

- bpo-12147: Adjust the new-in-3.2 smtplib.send_message method for better
  conformance to the RFCs: correctly handle Sender and Resent- headers.

  instruction.

- bpo-12442: new shutil.disk_usage function, providing total, used and free
  disk space statistics.

- bpo-12451: The XInclude default loader of xml.etree now decodes files from

  encoding cookie, instead of opening it in UTF-8.

- bpo-9516: On Mac OS X, change Distutils to no longer globally attempt to
  check or set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable for the
  interpreter process.  This could cause failures in non-Distutils
  subprocesses and was unreliable since tests or user programs could modify
  the interpreter environment after Distutils set it.  Instead, have
  Distutils set the deployment target only in the environment of each build
  subprocess.  It is still possible to globally override the default by
  setting MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET before launching the interpreter; its
  value must be greater or equal to the default value, the value with which
  the interpreter was built.  Also, implement the same handling in
  packaging.

  wrapper module into __init__, eliminating the module.  Since __init__ was
  already importing the function to curses.wrapper, there is no API change.

  to it is a Header object, and Header/make_header no longer fail if given
  binary unknown-8bit input.

  the test suite twice to check for bugs in .pyc generation.
  Tools/scripts/run_test.py provides an easy platform-independent way to run
  test suite with sensible defaults.

- bpo-12331: The test suite for the packaging module can now run from an
  installed Python.

- bpo-12331: The test suite for lib2to3 can now run from an installed
  Python.

- bpo-12626: In regrtest, allow to filter tests using a glob filter with the
  ``-m`` (or ``--match``) option.  This works with all test cases using the
  unittest module.  This is useful with long test suites such as test_io or
  test_subprocess.

- bpo-12624: It is now possible to fail after the first failure when running
  in verbose mode (``-v`` or ``-W``), by using the ``--failfast`` (or
  ``-G``) option to regrtest.  This is useful with long test suites such as
  test_io or test_subprocess.

  overzealous DNS service (e.g. OpenDNS) redirects to a placeholder Web
  site.

- Avoid failing in test_urllibnet.test_bad_address when some overzealous DNS
  service (e.g. OpenDNS) resolves a non-existent domain name.  The test is
  now skipped instead.

- bpo-12440: When testing whether some bits in SSLContext.options can be
  reset, check the version of the OpenSSL headers Python was compiled
  against, rather than the runtime version of the OpenSSL library.

  test in a fresh process with only one thread and to not change signal
  handling of the parent process.

- bpo-8716: Avoid crashes caused by Aqua Tk on OSX when attempting to run
  test_tk or test_ttk_guionly under a username that is not currently logged
  in to the console windowserver (as may be the case under buildbot or ssh).

- bpo-12407: Explicitly skip test_capi.EmbeddingTest under Windows.

- bpo-12400: regrtest -W doesn't rerun the tests twice anymore, but captures
  the output and displays it on failure instead. regrtest -v doesn't print
  the error twice anymore if there is only one error.

- bpo-12141: Install copies of template C module file so that test_build_ext
  of test_distutils and test_command_build_ext of test_packaging are no
  longer silently skipped when run outside of a build directory.

- bpo-11223: Skip test_lock_acquire_interruption() and
  test_rlock_acquire_interruption() of test_threadsignals if a thread lock
  is implemented using a POSIX mutex and a POSIX condition variable. A POSIX
  condition variable cannot be interrupted by a signal (e.g. on Linux, the
  futex system call is restarted).

  Patch written by Ray Allen.

- bpo-10830: Fix PyUnicode_FromFormatV("%c") for non-BMP characters on
  narrow build.

  Py_UNICODE_JOIN_SURROGATES.

- bpo-12724: Add Py_RETURN_NOTIMPLEMENTED macro for returning
  NotImplemented.
